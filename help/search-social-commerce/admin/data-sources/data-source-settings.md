# [!DNL Google Analytics] data source settings

| Section | Parameter | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [!UICONTROL Connect to Google Analytics] | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics Account ID] | The ID of the [!DNL Google Analytics] account from which data is pulled. All API usage to pull data is billed to the specified account. The account must give "Read and Analyze" permissions to the specified email address.<br><br>To find your ID, log in to [!DNL Google Analytics]. In the upper left, click **[!DNL All accounts]** to open a list of your accounts. The ID for each account is under the account name. |
| | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics Login] | Specify the login/email address to use to access data for this data source. The login must be registered to a [!DNL Google] account and have "Read & Analyze" permissions for the [!DNL Google Analytics] account. See the [instructions for assigning user permissions in [!DNL Google Analytics]](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9305587).<br><br><b>Note:</b> If you change the password for this login account, then all open connections to the account are closed. To resume syncing data, return to this page and [reauthenticate](data-source-reauthenticate.md). |
| [!UICONTROL Account Details] | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics Account Name] | (Read-only; connected accounts only) The account name. |
| | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics Property] | The property (website, mobile application, or device) from which to collect data for the [!DNL Google Analytics] account.<br><br> To integrate metrics for multiple properties, set up a separate data source for each property. |
| | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics View] | The view that contains the data set you want to access. If the property has multiple views, consider pulling the unfiltered view at the highest level, which contains all data.<br><br>To integrate metrics for multiple views for the same property, set up a separate data source for each view. Make sure that the views don't include overlapping data. |
| | [!UICONTROL Google Analytics Dimension] | The [!DNL Google Analytics] custom dimension that's populated with the value of the Adobe Advertising "ef_id" query string parameter. If you don't see the correct dimension listed, contact your [!DNL Google Analytics] implementation team.<br><br>The "ef_id" is used as the primary key to pass data from [!DNL Google Analytics] to Adobe Advertising. |
| [!UICONTROL Import Metrics] | [!UICONTROL Available Metrics] | All available metrics for the specified [!DNL Google Analytics] property and view that aren't imported for the data source, organized by category. The list includes the imported friendly name and back-end name (starting with &quot;ga.&quot;) for each metric. The [!UICONTROL Refresh] button refreshes the list with any new metrics in [!DNL Google Analytics].<br><br>To import an available metric, drag it into the [!UICONTROL Selected Metrics] section.<br><br>See "[Available [!DNL Google Analytics] Metrics in Advertising Cloud](data-source-ga-metrics.md)." |
| | Selected Metrics | All metrics for the specified [!DNL Google Analytics] property and view that are imported for the data source, and validation status for each metric. The list includes the imported friendly name and back-end name (starting with "`ga.`") for each metric. Each data source can include four default traffic metrics that you can't remove ([!UICONTROL Pageviews], [!UICONTROL Sessions], [!UICONTROL Bounces], and [!UICONTROL Session Duration]) and up to 16 additional valid metrics or metrics without data. You can edit the metric list at any time.<br><br>To import a metric, select it in the [!UICONTROL Available Metrics] pane and drag it here.<br><br><b>Caution:</b> [!DNL Google Analytics] permits up to 10 metrics in a single data feed. Each of your data sources in Search, Social, & Commerce can include up to two feeds with a total of 20 metrics, but using a second feed doubles your API calls to [!DNL Google Analytics]. If you have many metrics, select only the metrics that you want to use in objectives for optimization. You can view your quotas for this project in [the [!DNL Google API Console]](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analytics-json.googleapis.com/quotas). See more about [quotas and call limits for API requests to [!DNL Google Analytics]](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/limits-quotas).<br><br><b>Notes:</b><br><ul><li>The friendly name is imported as the display name for a metric in the [!UICONTROL Admin] &gt; [!UICONTROL Transactions Properties] view and is appended with "<code>_ga:<metric_tag configured in the Metric Tag field></code>" (such as "Pageviews_ga:UK"). You can optionally edit the display name of your custom goals and custom metrics, but the display names for all common metrics are overwritten each day with the friendly names in [!DNL Google Analytics], appended with the specified tags.</li><li>Page views, sessions, bounce rate (calculated as bounces/sessions), and session duration are automatically factored into the portfolio bidding algorithms. You can manually add any other metric to a portfolio objective.</li><li>When you remove a metric from the data source, Adobe Advertising keeps the historic data according to the normal [data retention policy](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/data-used-for-reports.md).</li></ul> |
| Metric Tag | Metric Tag | A tag to append to each selected [!DNL Google Analytics] metric in Adobe Advertising, preceded by "<code>_ga:</code>" (such as "Pageviews_ga:<metric_tag>"). The tag can be from 2-5 alphanumeric characters and must be unique for the advertiser.<br><br>This tag helps you to identify the data source for each metric. This tag is especially important when you set up multiple data sources because each data source includes some of the same metric names (including [!UICONTROL Pageviews], [!UICONTROL Sessions], [!UICONTROL Bounces], and [!UICONTROL Session Duration], and potentially other metrics). Appending different metric tags prevents duplicate metric names.<br><br>For example, if you set up separate integrations for your UK property and your JP property, then you might use "UK" and "JP" as your metric tags. The [!UICONTROL Pageviews] metrics for the two properties then appear accordingly in Adobe Advertising as "Pageviews_ga:UK" and "Pageviews_ga:JP." |
