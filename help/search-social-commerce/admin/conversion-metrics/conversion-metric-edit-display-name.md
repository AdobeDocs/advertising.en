# Change the display name for a conversion metric

You can optionally change the name that is shown in column headings for readability when a [conversion](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) metric is [available for campaign and portfolio management views and in reports](conversion-metric-edit-available.md). For example, if you collect registration data using a conversion metric named *reg*, then you can optionally change the display name to see it displayed as "Registrations."

You can't delete an existing display name.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For [metrics from Google Analytics](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/data-sources/data-source-about.md), any manual changes to the display name are overwritten if you update or reauthenticate the integration. Similarly, any name changes within Google Analytics are ignored unless you [update](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/data-sources/data-source-edit.md) or [reauthenticate](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/data-sources/data-source-reauthenticate.md) the integration.
