# View the conversion metrics tracked for an advertiser

You can view a list of all [conversion](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) metrics that Adobe Advertising has tracked for an advertiser. Each metric row includes the source of the metric.

* In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Admin] > [!UICONTROL Conversions]**.

All conversion metrics that have been gathered for the advertiser, and any different display names assigned to them, are listed.

>[!TIP]
>
>Once the advertiser (or the ad network) stops collecting a conversion metric, [hide it from management views and reports](conversion-metric-edit-available.md) unless you want to use it for viewing historical data.
