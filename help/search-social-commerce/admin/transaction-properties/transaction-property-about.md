# About managing an advertiser's transaction properties

The [transaction properties](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#s-t) that Adobe Advertising tracks for an advertiser, including [conversion and site engagement metrics synced from Adobe Analytics](/help/integrations/analytics/analytics-data-in-advertising.md), are used throughout Search, Social, & Commerce and Advertising DSP.

* In Search, Social, & Commerce, you can use your transaction properties to create objectives, which are used to optimize portfolios. In addition, data for the transaction properties can be displayed in columns in campaign and portfolio management views and in reports.

* In Advertising DSP, you can use transaction properties to [create custom goals](/help/dsp/optimization/custom-goal-create.md), which are used to optimize packages.

By default, none of an advertiser's transaction properties &mdash; except for conversions tracked by [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Google Analytics], and [!DNL MicrosoftÂ® Advertising] universal event tracking tags &mdash; are available for campaign and portfolio management views and reports. They are available only when you specifically make them available and include a display name, which is the name that is shown. When you make a transaction property available, you can either use the property name exactly as it is spelled in the retrieved data or change the name that's shown in column headings for readability.

From the list of properties that you make available, each user with access to the advertiser's data can customize the properties they see for management views and reports by including or omitting specific properties. Users with sufficient access privileges can also optimize for specific properties by associating them with portfolios or DSP package-level custom goals.
