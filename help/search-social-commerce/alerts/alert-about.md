# About custom alerts

You can create alert templates to identify when any portfolio, account, campaign, ad group, keyword, ad, or shopping product group meets specific conditions &mdash; such as a performance metric &mdash; during a specified period and then generate an alert. Alerts are available for a single advertiser. Alerts include all columns in the relevant default view. For example, campaign-level alerts include all columns in the default [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view.

You can create alert templates from either the [!UICONTROL Alert Templates] view or from the campaign management view for the entity type to be evaluated.

When an alert instance is triggered for an alert template:

* The specified recipients receive an email notice. When the alert contains up to 1000 records, the email notice includes a [CSV](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) file with the alert data, including data for all entities that triggered the alert.

* The alert is listed in the [!UICONTROL Triggered Alerts] view in [!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Custom Alerts]. A downloadable report is available for ten days after the alert is triggered. 

* The alert is listed in the [!UICONTROL Notifications] center in the applicable entity view, which is available from the right toolbar. Notifications remain in the [!UICONTROL Notifications] center unless you delete them or mark them as read.

Within the [!UICONTROL Custom Alerts] view, the [!UICONTROL Alert Templates] view lists all alert templates created for the account, and you can create, edit, pause, reactivate, and delete alert templates. The [!UICONTROL Triggered Alerts] view lists the generated alert instances.
