# Export data for custom alerts

You can export data for a triggered alert or data for the most recently triggered alert for an alert template as a [!DNL Microsoft® Excel] workbook ([XLS](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#w-x) file), a tab-separated values ([TSV](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#s-t)) file, or a comma-separated values ([CSV](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d)) file. Downloadable reports are available for ten days after the alert is triggered and are then automatically deleted.

1. Do either of the following:
   
   * (To export data for the most recently triggered alert for an alert template) In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Custom Alerts]**, which opens to the Alert Templates view.
   
   * (To export data for a specific triggered alert) In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Custom Alerts]**. In the submenu, click **[!UICONTROL Triggered Alerts]**.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Export] column next to the template or report name, click the name of a format, and then open or save the file according to your browser's normal procedure:
   
   * **[!UICONTROL XLS]** — For an [!DNL Excel] workbook with a single worksheet (XLS). The report includes one worksheet, labeled at the top with the parameters, with one row for each included component when data for the component is available. Rows with no data are omitted. Basic reports include a total for each numeric column.
   
   * **[!UICONTROL TSV]** — For a TSV file. The report includes the parameters and one row for each included component.
   
   * **[!UICONTROL CSV]** — For a CSV file. The report includes the parameters and one row for each included component.
