# Select multiple rows

You can select multiple rows in the [!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Search > Label Classifications], and [!UICONTROL Optimization] > [!UICONTROL Constraints] views in the following ways:

* Keyboard shortcuts:

  * **[!DNL Shift+Click]**: To select multiple, consecutive rows, click the first one and press **[!DNL Shift]** while you click the last one. 

  * **[!DNL Ctrl+Click]**: To select multiple, non-consecutive rows, click the first one and then press **[!DNL Ctrl]** while you click each additional row.

* Global check box (![Check box](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/check-box.png) "Check box") in the upper-left column heading:

  * To select all rows on the current page &mdash; which may include some or all rows available with the applied filters, based on whether you're viewing 25 rows, 50 rows, 100 rows, 200 rows, or [!UICONTROL Continuous Scroll] &mdash; select the global check box.
  
    When you select all rows on the page, you can de-select individual rows.

  * To select all rows available with the applied filters, select the global check box, and then click **[!DNL Select all N records?]**, where *N* is the number of available records.
  
    When you select all rows available, you can't de-select individual rows.
