# Apply a data filter from a column heading menu

<!-- Doesn't include instructions for legacy Portfolios or Reports views -->

You can apply as many filters as you want to a column, one at a time.<!-- True only for entity names, I think: All filters are joined using the AND operator. --> To add more than one filter at a time using all available metrics, see "[Apply data filters from the toolbar](column-filter-apply-from-toolbar.md)."

1. On the right side of the column heading, click ![Down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-dropdown.png "Down arrow"), and then click **[!UICONTROL Add Filter]**.

1. Define the filter on the column:

   * (Filters without input fields) Select the check boxes next to each value to include, and then click ![Update Filter](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/select.png "Add").

   * (Filters with input fields) Select an operator from the second menu, enter the applicable value, and then click ![Update Filter](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/select.png "Add").
   
     For example, if you've selected the "[!UICONTROL Clicks]" column and want to return only rows with more than 100 clicks, then select *[!UICONTROL greater than]*" and enter `100` in the input field Depending on the data type, available operators may include *[!UICONTROL greater than]*, *[!UICONTROL less than]*, *[!UICONTROL equals]*, *[!UICONTROL contains]*, *[!UICONTROL doesn't contain]*, *[!UICONTROL starts with]*, *[!UICONTROL ends with]*, *[!UICONTROL no value]*, *[!UICONTROL has value]*, *[!UICONTROL before]*, *[!UICONTROL after]*, or *[!UICONTROL no date].*
     
     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >* Text values aren't case-sensitive. For example, if you filter by campaigns with "loan" in the name, the results include "Consumer Loans" and "loan applications."
     >* You can apply only one simple numeric filter (such as [!UICONTROL Impressions] \> 100) per column.
