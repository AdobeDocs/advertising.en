# Edit and sort the column set from the [!UICONTROL Custom Columns] icon

You can change the visible columns in any of your views from the right toolbar. The changes are applied only until you leave the campaign management views or you view data for a different advertiser.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also temporarily change the columns in a view without changing the sort order [from any column heading](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/data-views/ad-hoc-settings/column-set-edit-column-heading.md) in the view.
>
>You can save changes to the columns that are included for a specific advertiser by editing the default view or [creating a custom view](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/data-views/custom-default-views-manage.md#create-custom-view).
