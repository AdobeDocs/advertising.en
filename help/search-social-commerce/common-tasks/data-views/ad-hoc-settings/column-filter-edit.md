     1. (Optional) To filter the column names by text string, enter the search string in the **[!UICONTROL ADD FILTER]** input field.

          For example, if you've selected the "[!UICONTROL Clicks]" column and want to return only rows with more than 100 clicks, then select *[!UICONTROL greater than]*" and enter `100` in the input field.
