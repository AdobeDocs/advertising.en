# Lock and unlock a column configuration in campaign views

Locking a column "locks" that column and all other columns to the left of it into one static pane, and all columns to the right into another pane through which you can scroll horizontally.

A lock works only until you move away from the entity view. You can't save it to the default or custom view.

* (To lock a column configuration) On the right side of the column heading, click ![Down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-dropdown.png "Down arrow"), and then select **[!UICONTROL Lock Column]**.

* (To unlock a column configuration) On the right side of any column heading in the locked column set, click ![Down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-dropdown.png "Down arrow"), and then select **[!UICONTROL Unlock Column]**.
