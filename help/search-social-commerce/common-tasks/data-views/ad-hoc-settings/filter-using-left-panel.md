# Filter data using the left navigation panel

From the left navigation panel, you can:

* Browse or search for entities by ad network, and filter by the status of the entity and the status of the account, campaign, and ad group. Click any entity or entity group in the panel to load a view of the child entities (for example, click a campaign name to view its child ad groups).

* Browse or search for campaigns by portfolio or portfolio group, and filter by the status of the entity and the status of the portfolio group, portfolio, and campaign. Click any portfolio group, portfolio, or campaign in the panel to load data for the portfolio group, portfolio, or campaign within the current entity view.

* Access, edit, and reset your default views; and access, edit, and delete your custom views. Clicking any view name loads the appropriate view.
