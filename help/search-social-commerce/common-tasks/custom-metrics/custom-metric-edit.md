# Edit a custom metric

If you edit a custom metric that's included as a column in one of your default views or custom views, or in a report template, then the new formula is used the next time you refresh the view or run the report, respectively.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Complex custom metrics take longer to calculate, and reports and views that include them &mdash; especially when they include separate columns for click-through and view-through conversions &mdash; take longer to be generated.
