# About the new user interface

You can now manage your objectives, simulations, and portfolios from the new user interface (UI). You can also perform some tasks on campaigns and ad groups and open some legacy views. The new Search, Social, & Commerce user interface runs in a new URL within the https://experience.adobe.com domain.

Over time, additional features will be moved to the new user interface. In the meantime, you can easily switch between the new UI and the legacy UI.

For more information about how the new UI is organized, see "[How the user interface is organized](/help/search-social-commerce/getting-started/user-interface.md)."

>[!NOTE]
>
>Descriptions of some settings within the new UI, as well as conceptual information, best practices, and help for legacy features, is still available in the "[!DNL Search, Social, & Commerce Optimization Guide]." The [!DNL Optimization Guide] is available from the [!UICONTROL Help] menu (![Help menu](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/help-main-menu.png "Help menu")) in the upper right of any page within Search, Social, & Commerce.
