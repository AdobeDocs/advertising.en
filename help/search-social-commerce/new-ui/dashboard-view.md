# (New UI) View your performance dashboard

*Beta feature*

<!-- See wiki pageId=3404513731 for more things that may be added -->

The customizable [!UICONTROL Dashboard] allows you to monitor the performance of all of your portfolios <!-- May later include other entity-level data --> so you can identify potential performance issues to investigate and resolve. You can view daily, weekly, or monthly data for any time period in the last 90 days.

Your [!UICONTROL Dashboard] includes the following visual reports:

* **Trends:** The overall trends for up to three (3) specified metrics.

* **Biggest Movers - \[selected metric\]:** The 10 portfolios with the largest change to a specified metric compared to the previous time period.

* **Spend Distribution:** The spend distribution by ad network.
