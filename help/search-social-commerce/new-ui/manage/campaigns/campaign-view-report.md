# (New UI) Manage data view reports from the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view

<!-- Wording??????  Filtered data reports? -->

*Beta feature*

You can generate a report that includes the data rows for one or more campaigns in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view, and then download the report as a Microsoft Excel worksheet file (XLXS format). The report includes all visible columns in the view.

You can delete any generated report.
