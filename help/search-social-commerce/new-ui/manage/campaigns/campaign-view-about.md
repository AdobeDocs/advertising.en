# (New UI) About the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view

The [!UICONTROL Manage] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view lists all campaigns in your account. You can open a list of ad groups in the campaign by clicking the campaign name.

Above the data table, you can open a performance graph with up to three metrics totalled across all campaigns in the view for the specified date range.
