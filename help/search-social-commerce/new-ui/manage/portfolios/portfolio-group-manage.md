# (New UI) Manage portfolio groups

*Beta feature*

You can group any subset of portfolios for an advertiser so that you can view composite standard metrics and revenue metrics for the entire group. For example, you can group portfolios with similar objectives and customize the data columns accordingly for the group. Portfolio groups affect data reporting only, not optimization.

A portfolio can be assigned to only one portfolio group at a time.

You can create portfolio groups, add and remove portfolios from portfolio groups, rename a portfolio group, filter the [!UICONTROL Portfolios] view to show only the portfolios in that group, and delete a portfolio group.
