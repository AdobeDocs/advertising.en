# (New UI) Manage data view reports from the [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] view

*Beta feature*

You can generate a report that includes the data rows for one or more ad groups in the [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] view, and then download the report as a Microsoft Excel worksheet file (XLXS format). The report includes all visible columns in the view.

You can delete any generated report.
