# (New UI) Manage constraint assignments for ad groups

*Beta feature*

You can assign and remove bidding constraints for the following search entities: campaign, ad group, keyword, placement, unit-level product group, and dynamic search target. Each entity can have only one constraint.

Constraints are inherited by child entities, so you don't need to assign constraints for child entities unless you want to override the inherited values.

Unassigning a constraint removes the association with the account components and all of their child components, and report data for the constraint is no longer available for those components. Unassigning a constraint doesn't delete the constraint nor the account components themselves.

## Assign a constraint to selected ad groups from the new [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] view

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Manage] > [!UICONTROL Ad Groups]**.

1. Select the check box next to each ad group to which you'll assign a single constraint.

1. In the bulk actions toolbar, click **+ [!UICONTROL Assign]** > **[!UICONTROL Constraint]**.
