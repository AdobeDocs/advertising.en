# (New UI) Create an objective

*Beta feature*

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can associate an objective with a portfolio when you [create the portfolio](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/manage/portfolios/portfolio-create.md) or by later [modifying the portfolio settings](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/manage/portfolios/portfolio-edit.md). You can use the same objective for multiple portfolios.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Plan] > [!UICONTROL Objectives]**.

1. In the upper right, click ![Add](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/add-new.png "Add").

1. Enter the objective settings.

  For instructions, see the help within the user interface or in the Optimization Guide, which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce.

1. At the bottom of the settings, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Objectives prefixed with "`ADSP_`" (not case-sensitive) for use with Advertising DSP packages are available as custom goals within DSP within two days.
