# Using the [!UICONTROL Spend Planner]

<!-- When this becomes a menu item, move file and TOC entry accordingly -->

The [!UICONTROL Spend Planner] (called the "Spend Recommendation Tool" in the legacy user interface) identifies the optimal spend distribution across optimized and active portfolios with the same objective and currency so that you can maximum revenue or target goals for the portfolio set.

When you view a spend recommendation report for portfolios with daily budgets, you can change the budgets for any of the portfolios to the recommended budgets.

## Data in the [!UICONTROL Spend Planner] report

For portfolios with the objective [!UICONTROL Maximize Clicks], the report includes spend recommendations and click projections. For all other objectives, the report includes spend recommendations and revenue projections.

Spend recommendation reports include the following data:

* A scatter line chart shows the predicted maximum revenue or clicks that can be achieved with a given total cost for the portfolio set when the individual spend targets are set optimally. The predicted cost for each revenue point or click point is included.

* Two donut charts showing the spend and expected revenue or click distribution by portfolio for 1\) the current spend targets and 2\) the proposed spend targets.

* A bar chart for each of the portfolios, showing the recommended daily spend (cost) and predicted revenue distribution or click distribution when you maintain the current total daily spend target across all selected portfolios, or for a proposed total spend target. You can optionally apply the recommended spend targets to the selected portfolios, which affects bidding in the next bid execution cycle.
