# [!DNL Google Ads] recommendations

| Recommendation Type | Description | Auto-Apply Recommendations with Search, Social, & Commerce Portfolios? | Comments |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [!UICONTROL Ads] and extensions (now called "Ads and assets" in [!DNL Google Ads]) | Recommendations for adding/editing ads and assets | Can be auto-applied, but advertisers should manually review recommendations. | Reviewing recommendations is necessary to ensure that responsive search ads are aligned with advertiser requirements. |
| [!UICONTROL Automated campaigns] | Recommendations for automated campaigns (local and smart campaigns) | Not available in Search, Social, & Commerce. | &mdash; |
| [!UICONTROL Bidding and budget] | Bid, budget, and target recommendations to improve performance | Don't auto-apply for campaigns in optimized portfolios. | Current recommendations may be one-dimensional for your purposes. For example, [!DNL Google Ads] recommends an increase in target CPA, without concern for budget, when clicks decrease for a campaign. |
| [!UICONTROL Keywords and targeting] | Keyword cleanup and audience recommendations | Can be auto-applied, but use auto-apply selectively. | Use keyword cleanup and removal of redundancies across campaigns, but avoid further automation (such as auto-creating dynamic search ads or auto-expanding audiences). |
| [!UICONTROL Measurement] | Recommendations for conversion tracking and certification | Not available in Search, Social, & Commerce. | These recommendations may impact performance. Consult with your Adobe Account Team to discuss the pros and cons of any recommendation before applying it. |
| [!UICONTROL Repairs] | Miscellaneous recommendations to improve account issues | Not available in Search, Social, & Commerce. | Periodically manually review repair recommendations within [!DNL Google Ads]. This recommendation type is a good way to identify disapproved ads, feed issues, tracking problems, and so on. |
| [!UICONTROL Other] | Recommendation to use the [!DNL Google Ads] mobile app | Not available in Search, Social, & Commerce. | &mdash; |
