# About publisher recommendations and insights support

*[!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts*

*Beta feature for [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts*

[!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] recommendations and insights are suggestions from the ad network to help improve the performance and efficiency of your campaigns: 

* Each [!DNL Google Ads] recommendation provides customized suggestions about different performance aspects of a campaign &mdash; from adding an asset to increasing the budget &mdash; based on your account's performance history, your campaign settings, and trends across [!DNL Google Ads].

* Each [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] performance insight and recommendation suggests changes to optimize campaign performance based on machine learning algorithms and best practices.

## The [!UICONTROL Recommendations & Publisher Insights] view

Within [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Recommendations & Publisher Insights], you can:

* See at a glance all supported recommendations that haven't been acted on for an account. Information for each entry includes the recommendation type, the [!DNL Adobe] recommendation, the affected metrics, the affected entity, and a link to more details. Predicted increases to metrics are highlighted in green.

  ![Recommendations UI](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/recommendations-ui.png "Recommendations UI")

  The data is available in real time when you open the view. To refresh the data, click ![Refresh](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/refresh.png "Refresh") on the bottom left of the page.

* For [DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts, see at a glance each performance insight generated in the last 30 days for a [DNL Microsoft® Advertising] account. Insights provide similar information to recommendations but in a different format. Each insight includes the date, a description of the issue, the impacted entity, the root cause (which may include links to more details), and the suggested action with a link to open the Microsoft® Advertising editor, from which you can act on the specific insight.

* View details about a recommendation, and directly apply or dismiss the recommendation.
  
* View a log of each recommendation that was applied for the account, including the affected entities, who applied the recommendation, and the time stamp.

>While ad network recommendations and performance insights help you improve campaign performance, some may not align with your broader goals. As a result, it's best to consult with your Adobe Account Team before implementing any recommendation or insight.
