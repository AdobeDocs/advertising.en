# About publisher recommendations and insights support

*[!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts*

*Beta feature for [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts*

[!DNL Google Ads] recommendations and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] performance insights are suggestions from the ad network to help improve the performance and efficiency of your campaigns:

* Each [!DNL Google Ads] recommendation provides customized suggestions about different performance aspects of a campaign &mdash; from adding an asset to increasing the budget &mdash; based on your account's performance history, your campaign settings, and trends across [!DNL Google Ads].

* Each [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] performance insight alerts you to a significant fluctuation in a manager account, advertiser account, or campaign; identifies the possible causes, and suggests actions to optimize performance.

## The [!UICONTROL Recommendations & Publisher Insights] view

Within [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Recommendations & Publisher Insights], you can:

* See at a glance all supported recommendations that haven't been acted on for a [!DNL Google Ads] account or all performance insights generated in the last 30 days for a [Microsoft® Advertising] account. Information for each entry includes the recommendation/insight details and the entities affected. For [!DNL Google Ads] accounts, predicted increases to metrics are highlighted in green.

  The data is available in real time when you open the view. To refresh the data, click ![Refresh](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/refresh.png "Refresh") on the bottom left of the page.

* For [!DNL Google Ads] accounts:

  * View recommendation details, and directly apply or dismiss a recommendation.
  
  * View a log of each recommendation that was applied for the account, including the affected entities, who applied the recommendation, and the time stamp.

* For [Microsoft® Advertising] accounts, open the [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] editor, from which you can act on a specific insight.

>While ad network recommendations and performance insights help you improve campaign performance, some may not align with your broader goals. As a result, it's best to consult with your Adobe Account Team before implementing any recommendation or insight.
