# Change your password

<!-- Replace this with just a link to the DX page once we remove the legacy option? -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is applicable only to your legacy Search, Social, & Commerce login credentials. Most users now use an [!DNL Adobe] ID for authentication instead. To change the password for your [!DNL Adobe] ID, see "[Reset or change your Adobe password](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/change-or-reset-password.html)."

Changing your password logs you out of the current session. To continue working, you must sign in with the new password.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search, Social, & Commerce] > [!UICONTROL Tools] > [!UICONTROL Change Password]**.

1. Enter information in the fields, and then click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

   **[!UICONTROL Password]:** The new password. It must consist of at least eight characters, with at least one uppercase letter and one number.
   
   **[!UICONTROL Confirm Password]:** The new password.

1. In the confirmation message, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   Your current session ends, and the login prompt is displayed so you can log back in using the new password.
