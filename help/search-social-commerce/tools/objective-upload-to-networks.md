# Enable uploading of objectives to ad networks

*Advertisers with [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] accounts only*

*Advertisers enabled for hybrid optimization only*

If your advertiser account is configured to use hybrid optimization, then Adobe Advertising can optionally upload the objectives for the account's portfolios to [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] as conversions so you can use them for hybrid optimization.

Enabling this option automatically triggers an upload for portfolios that contain campaigns with smart bidding strategies. Search, Social, & Commerce creates a conversion on the ad network for each applicable portfolio-and-objective combination. Each conversion has the name `ACS_OBJ_SID_<portfolio_id>_<se_acctid/conversion_manager_se_acctid>`, where `<portfolio_id>` is the numeric portfolio ID and `<se_acctid/conversion_manager_se_acctid>` is the numeric ID for the ad network account or manager account. The conversion represents all weighted conversion metrics in the objective.

Uploads to [!DNL Google Ads] occur daily at 06:00 in the advertiser's time zone. Uploads to [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] occur daily at 09:00 in the advertiser's time zone.

<!-- Note to self: Conversions tracked by Google Ads and by the Microsoft Advertising universal event tracking (UET) tag aren't re-uploaded to the ad networks. -->
