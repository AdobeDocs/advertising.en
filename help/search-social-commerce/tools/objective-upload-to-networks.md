# Enable uploading of objectives to ad networks

*Advertisers with [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] accounts only*

*Advertisers enabled for hybrid optimization only*

Search, Social, & Commerce can upload the objectives for an advertiser account's portfolios to [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] so you can use them for hybrid optimization. Your uploaded objectives are available as conversion actions for account-level and campaign-level custom conversion goals.

Enabling this option automatically triggers an upload for objectives in portfolios that contain campaigns with smart bidding strategies. Search, Social, & Commerce creates a conversion on the ad network for each applicable objective. The conversion represents all weighted conversion metrics in the objective. Each conversion has one of the following names:

* `O_ACS_OBJ_<network_ID>_<objective_ID>_<network_account_ID>`

  where `<network_ID>` is the numeric ID that Search, Social, & Commerce uses for the ad network, `<objective_id>` is the numeric objective ID, and `<network_account_ID>` is the numeric ID for the ad network account or manager account.

* (Old format that will be deprecated in the future) `ACS_OBJ_SID_<portfolio_id>_<se_acctid/conversion_manager_se_acctid>`

  where `<portfolio_id>` is the numeric portfolio ID and `<se_acctid/conversion_manager_se_acctid>` is the numeric ID for the ad network account or manager account.

  Your Adobe Account Team will work with you to migrate your existing conversion action names within the ad network before the old format is deprecated. During the migration period, both the old and new format uploads will run in parallel. Modelling and optimization aren't affected because the new conversion actions will appear initially with "secondary" (not optimized) status and with 90 days of backfill data.

Uploads to [!DNL Google Ads] occur daily at 06:00 in the advertiser's time zone. Uploads to [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] occur daily at 09:00 in the advertiser's time zone.

<!-- Note to self: Conversions tracked by Google Ads and by the Microsoft Advertising universal event tracking (UET) tag aren't re-uploaded to the ad networks. -->

[!IMPORTANT] Each campaign in a hybrid portfolio must use the same conversion goals as the portfolio's objective. Using different conversion goals may impact portfolio performance.
