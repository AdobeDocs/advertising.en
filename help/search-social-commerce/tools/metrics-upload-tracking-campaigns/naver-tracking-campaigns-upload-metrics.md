# Upload traffic and conversion metrics for [!DNL Naver] tracking-only accounts

*Naver Accounts Only*

You can upload a TSV, CSV, or TXT file of daily-aggregated traffic metrics and conversion metrics for tracking and reporting only for your ad network accounts. The data must follow a [specified format](naver-tracking-campaigns-data-requirements.md). If the file contains data for entities that don't exist in Search, Social, & Commerce, then those rows are skipped.

Search, Social, & Commerce doesn't synchronize data with the ad network, nor place bids for the account.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Tools] > [!UICONTROL Generic Tracking]**.

1. Select the ad network.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Choose File]** to locate the file on your device or network.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**.
