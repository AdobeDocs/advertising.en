*[!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL MicrosoftÂ® Advertising], [!DNL Yahoo! Japan Ads] (delete actions only), and [!DNL Yandex] accounts only*

You can stop posting campaign data generated from a feed in the following ways.

* While data is still being propagated, stop the propagation job so no data is available to post:

  1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Advanced (ACM)]**, which opens to the [!UICONTROL Templates] tab.

  1. In the "[!UICONTROL Last Prop. Status]" column next to the template name, click **[!UICONTROL Cancel]**.

* If the data is already propagated, then [cancel the posting job from the [!UICONTROL Bulksheets] view](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-stop-job.md).
