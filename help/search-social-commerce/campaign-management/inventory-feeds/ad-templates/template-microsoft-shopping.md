## \[Above all tabs\]

<!-- **Template Name:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-name.md}}

<!-- **Status:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-status.md}}

<!-- **Account:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-account.md}}

## \[Left panel\]

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Feed &amp; Columns]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-feed-and-columns.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Modifiers]:** -->

## [!UICONTROL Campaigns]

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Campaign]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-campaign.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Campaign Map Only]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-shopping-campaign-map-only.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Campaign Map Method]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-shopping-campaign-map-method.md}}

**[!UICONTROL Campaign Tracking Template]:** (Optional for templates for client feed files) The campaign-level tracking template, which specifies all off-landing domain redirects and tracking parameters and embeds the final URL in a parameter. This value overrides the account-level setting, but tracking templates at more granular levels (with keyword as the most granular) override this value.

* For Adobe Advertising conversion tracking, which is applied when the campaign settings include &quot;[!UICONTROL EF Redirect]&quot; and &quot;[!UICONTROL Auto Upload],&quot; do one of the following":

  * (Recommended) Use the [tracking template format for Microsoft速 shopping campaigns](/help/search-social-commerce/tracking/formats-click-tracking-microsoft.md). If the entire account is dedicated to shopping ads, you can instead define a tracking template at the account level.
  
  * If you instead include a value for each product in the feed using the "[!DNL bingads_redirect]" column (using the [correct format](/help/search-social-commerce/tracking/formats-click-tracking-microsoft.md)), then enter the parameter `{lpurl}`. You can optionally add third-party redirects and tracking to the `{lpurl}` parameter.

* For third-party redirects and tracking, enter a value.

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Campaign Final URL Suffix]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/final-url-suffix.md}}

**[!UICONTROL Merchant ID]:** The customer ID of the merchant account whose products are used for the campaign.

**[!UICONTROL Sales Country]:** The country in which the campaign's products are sold. Because products are associated
with target countries, this setting determines which products are advertised in the campaign.

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Stock Level]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-campaign-stock-level.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL This column has non-numeric values]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-nonnumeric-values.md}}

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-campaign-manage-settings-new-campaigns.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Initial Budget]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-campaign-initial-budget.md}}

**[!UICONTROL Campaign Priority]:** The priority with which the campaign is used when multiple campaigns advertise the
same product: *[!UICONTROL Low]* (the default for new campaigns), *[!UICONTROL Medium]*, or *[!UICONTROL High]*. When the same product is included in more than one campaign, the ad network uses
the campaign priority first to determine which campaign (and associated bid) is eligible for the ad auction. When all campaigns have the same priority, the campaign with the highest bid is eligible.

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Locations]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-campaign-locations.md}}

## [!UICONTROL Ad Groups]

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Ad Group]:** -->

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Map Method]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-ad-group-map-method.md }}

**[!UICONTROL Ad Group Tracking Template]:** (Optional) An ad group-level tracking template, which specifies all off-landing domain redirects and tracking parameters and embeds the final URL in a parameter. This value overrides the account- and campaign-level settings, but tracking templates at more granular levels override this value.

For Adobe Advertising conversion tracking, you don't need to enter a value. The campaign-level value is enough.

For third-party redirects and tracking, enter a value.

### [!UICONTROL Ad Group Level Negative Keywords]

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-ad-group-negative-keywords.md}}

## [!UICONTROL Product Groups]

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Tier 2 - Tier 8]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-tier2-8.md}}

<!-- **[!UICONTROL Row Level Value]:** -->

{{$include /help/_includes/inventory-feed-template-row-level-value.md}}

**[!UICONTROL Tracking Template]:** (Units without child product groups; optional) The tracking template for the product
group, which specifies all off-landing domain redirects and tracking parameters and embeds the final URL in a [!DNL ValueTrack] parameter. This template overrides templates at higher levels.

For Adobe Advertising conversion tracking, you don't need to enter a value. The campaign-level value is enough.

For third-party redirects and tracking, enter a value.

**[!UICONTROL Initial Bid]:** The initial bid for each ad.
