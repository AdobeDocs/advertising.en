# About [!DNL Google Ads] placements

*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts only*

Placements are locations on the display network in which your ads can appear. Placement settings include the maximum bid and optional tracking parameters. Placement-level settings override the ad group or campaign settings.

You can create placements for any ad group in a [supported [!DNL Google Ads] campaign type](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md) that targets the display network within a [synchronized search engine account](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-about.md).

## The [!UICONTROL Placements] views

The [!UICONTROL Placements] > [!UICONTROL Placements] view lists all of your placements, and the [!UICONTROL Placements] > [!UICONTROL Negatives] view lists all of your negative placements, for which ads aren't displayed.

You can create placements for an ad group from the [!UICONTROL Placements] > [!UICONTROL Placements] view. You can create negative keywords for any ad group or campaign from either the [!UICONTROL Placements] > [!UICONTROL Negatives] view or from the campaign and ad group settings.  You can also edit and change the status of active and paused placements, and delete negative placements.
