# Create for [!DNL Google Ads] negative placements

*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts only*

You can create negative placements for a [!DNL Google Ads] ad group in a campaign that targets the display network. Negative placements are sites in the display network that don't trigger ads.

>[!NOTE]
>You can also create and edit negative placements in the [ad group settings](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-manage.md) and [campaign settings](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-manage.md).

>[!TIP]
>To create many negative placements at once, use [campaign bulksheets](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-about.md).

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns]**. In the submenus, click **[!UICONTROL Live] > [!UICONTROL Placements] > [!UICONTROL Negatives]**.

1. In the toolbar above the data table, click ![Create](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/add.png "Create"), and then click **[!UICONTROL Campaign]** to create campaign-level negative placements or **[!UICONTROL Ad Group]** to create ad group-level negative placements.

1. Select the ad network, the account, the campaign, and (when relevant) the ad group, and then click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
