# Manage ad groups

*[!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising], [!DNL Yahoo! Japan Ads], [!DNL Yandex], and existing [!DNL Baidu] accounts only*

An ad group includes a set of ads and their related keywords. An ad group in a campaign that targets the display network can also include placements, which are locations on the display network in which your ads can appear. Ad group settings, which apply to all components of the ad group, vary by ad network.

You can create ad groups from within Search, Social, & Commerce for a [supported campaign type](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md) within a [synchronized ad network account](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-about.md). You also can edit and change the status of ad groups.

## Create an ad group

>[!TIP]
>
>To add large amounts of ad group data at once, use the [copy and paste feature](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/copy-paste.md) or [campaign bulksheets](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-about.md).

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns]**. In the submenus, click **[!UICONTROL Live] > [!UICONTROL Ad Groups]**.

1. In the toolbar above the data table, click ![Create](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/add.png "Create").

1. Select the ad network, the account, and the campaign, and then click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.

1. Enter the [Baidu](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-baidu.md), [Google Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-google.md), [Microsoft速 Advertising](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-microsoft.md), [Yahoo! Japan Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-yahoo-japan.md), or [Yandex](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-yandex.md) ad group settings.

   Depending on the ad network, the settings may be grouped into [!UICONTROL Ad Group Details], [!UICONTROL Budget Options], [!UICONTROL Ad Group Targeting], and [!UICONTROL URL Options]. To configure settings for [!UICONTROL Adgroup Frequency Cap Settings], [!UICONTROL Negative Keywords], [!UICONTROL Negative Websites], when they're available, click **[!UICONTROL Add Frequency Cap Settings]**, **[!UICONTROL Add Negative Keywords]**, or **[!UICONTROL Add Negative Websites]**, respectively.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Post]**.

Later, you can optionally override the ad group-level bids by setting bids for individual keywords or placements in the ad group.

## Edit ad group settings

You can edit settings for individual ad groups. You can also edit some fields for multiple ad groups at once, including some ad group details, budget options, and URL options that are common to all of the selected campaigns.

You can edit only the fields that are common to all of the selected ad groups, and your changes are applied to all of the selected ad groups.

For some monetary fields, you have options to change existing values to a specified value or to either increase or decrease the amount by a specified percentage or monetary amount, with a limit.

   For single ad groups, the settings may be grouped into [!UICONTROL Ad Group Details], [!UICONTROL Budget Options], [!UICONTROL Ad Group Targeting], and [!UICONTROL URL Options].
