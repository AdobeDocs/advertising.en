# Change the status of [!DNL Google Ads] placements and negative placements

You can pause an active, biddable placement to disable bidding on it. You can later resume bidding by changing the status back to active.

You also can delete an active or paused placement or a negative placement. Deleted placements/negative placements are deleted from the ad network. They're still visible, but you can't change them.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns]**. In the submenus, click **[!UICONTROL Live] > [!UICONTROL Placements] > \[[!UICONTROL Placements] \| [!UICONTROL Negatives]\]**.

1. (Optional) Filter the list to include specific placements or negative placements.

1. Select the check box next to each biddable placement or negative placement whose status you want to change.

   For tips on selecting multiple rows, see "[Select multiple rows](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/navigation-editing-selection/multiple-rows-select.md)."

   * (Biddable placements only) To pause the rows, click ![Pause](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/pause.png "Pause").
