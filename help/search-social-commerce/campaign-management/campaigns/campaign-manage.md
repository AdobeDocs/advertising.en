# Manage campaigns

*[!DNL Baidu], [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Microsoft Advertising], [!DNL Yahoo! Japan Ads], and [!DNL Yandex] accounts only*

A campaign is the primary component of an ad network account. For most campaign types, it consists of a set of ad groups or ad sets. Campaign settings include campaign budget parameters, ad targets, and optional tracking parameters for all ads in the campaign. Campaign-level tracking parameters override the account-level parameters but may themselves be overridden at a lower level.

Once you [make an ad network account accessible](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-manage.md) and Search, Social, & Commerce has synchronized the account data with the ad network, you can create new campaigns with [supported campaign types](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md). You also can edit and change the status of campaigns.

## Create a campaign

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Before you create a campaign, [implement conversion tracking tags](/help/search-social-commerce/tracking/conversion-tracking-about.md) in the advertiser's webpages.
>* To create a large number of campaigns at once, use the [copy and paste feature](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/copy-paste.md) or [campaign bulksheets](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-about.md).

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns]**. In the submenus, click **[!UICONTROL Live] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.

1. In the toolbar above the data table, click ![Create](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/add.png "Create").

1. Select the ad network, the account, and the campaign type, and then click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
   
   For the descriptions of each campaign type, see the [Baidu](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-baidu.md), [Google Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-google.md), [Microsoft Advertising](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-microsoft.md), [Yahoo! Japan Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-yahoo-japan.md), or [Yandex](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-yandex.md) campaign settings.

1. Enter the [Baidu](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-baidu.md), [Google Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-google.md), [Microsoft Advertising](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-microsoft.md), [Yahoo! Japan Ads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-yahoo-japan.md), or [Yandex](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-yandex.md) campaign settings.

   Depending on the ad network, the settings may be grouped into [!UICONTROL Campaign Details], [!UICONTROL Budget Options], [!UICONTROL Shopping Settings], [!UICONTROL Campaign Targeting], [!UICONTROL Conversion Goals], [[!UICONTROL Advanced Device Options], [!UICONTROL URL Options], and [!UICONTROL (Google) DSA Options]. To configure settings for [!UICONTROL Negative Keywords], [!UICONTROL Negative Websites], [!UICONTROL Campaign Tracking], or [!UICONTROL Asset Groups] (when available), click **[!UICONTROL Add Negative Keywords]**, **[!UICONTROL Add Negative Websites]**, **[!UICONTROL Set Campaign Tracking]**, **[!UICONTROL Set Campaign Goals]**, or **[!UICONTROL Manage Asset Groups]**, respectively.

Depending on the ad network on which the campaign was created, you may need to create associated ad groups and ads before the campaign is pushed to the ad network.

## Edit campaign settings

You can edit settings for individual campaigns. You can also edit some fields for multiple campaigns at once, including some campaign details, budget options, and URL options that are common to all of the selected campaigns.

   For multiple campaigns, the settings may be grouped into [!UICONTROL Campaign Details], [!UICONTROL Budget Options], and [!UICONTROL URL Options], depending on the ad networks. You can edit only the fields that are common to all of the selected campaigns, and your changes are applied to all of the selected campaigns. For some alphanumeric fields, you have options to change existing values to a specified value, replace an existing string with a specified string, add a specified prefix to the beginning of each value, or append a suffix to the end of each value. For some monetary fields, you have options to change existing values to a specified value or to either increase or decrease the amount by a specified percentage or monetary amount, with a limit.

   For single campaigns, the settings may be grouped into [!UICONTROL Campaign Details], [!UICONTROL Budget Options], [!UICONTROL Shopping Settings], [!UICONTROL Campaign Targeting], [!UICONTROL Conversion Goals], [!UICONTROL Advanced Device Options], [!UICONTROL URL Options], and [!UICONTROL (Google) DSA Options].
