# About [!DNL Google Ads] dynamic search targets

*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts only*

Dynamic search targets define whether the ad network will use all or a subset of the pages in your website to target your dynamic search ads. Configure dynamic search targets at the ad group level; they apply to all dynamic search ads in the same ad group.

Depending on your campaign settings, dynamic search targets may be required or optional:

* You must create dynamic search targets when you don't specify a website domain and language in the campaign's "[!UICONTROL DSA Options]" section.

* You can optionally create dynamic search targets when you specify a website domain and language in the campaign's "[!UICONTROL DSA Options]" section.
  
  [!DNL Google Ads] automatically shows your dynamic search ads based on the content of a website specified with these settings.

To best track performance, configure your campaign with one ad group per dynamic search target, and include an ad group that targets all criteria.
