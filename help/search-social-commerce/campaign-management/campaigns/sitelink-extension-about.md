# About sitelink extensions

*[!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] only*

A sitelink is an extra text link in a text ad listing. Use sitelinks to take users directly to specific pages in your site. The ad network determines which sitelinks to display with an ad, based on the relevance of the sitelink to the ad. You can optionally include descriptive text for each sitelink, which may be included in the ad. The ad network may automatically display ad copy from existing ads in the account with the sitelink when the ad copy is highly relevant to the sitelink. [!DNL Google Ads] may show 2-6 sitelinks in a desktop ad and up to four sitelinks in a mobile ad. [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] may show two, four, or six sitelinks with descriptions or 4-6 sitelinks without descriptions.

You create shared sitelink text and settings, including dates during which the sitelinks can appear with ads, at the account level. 

## The [!UICONTROL Sitelinks] and [!UICONTROL Associations] views

The [!UICONTROL Extensions] > [!UICONTROL Sitelinks] library in [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Campaigns] lists all of your account-level sitelinks, and you can create and manage your shared sitelinks there. See the ad network help for the maximum number of ad extensions per [[!DNL Google Ads] account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6372658) and per [[!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising] account](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52001). Sitelinks in your library aren't used with your ads until you assign them to account entities.

From the [!UICONTROL Extensions] > [!UICONTROL Associations] view, you can assign any of your sitelinks as possible extensions to all ads at the account level ([!DNL Google Ads] only), campaign level, or ad group level ([!DNL Google Ads] only).

## Performance data for sitelinks

Search, Social, & Commerce maps the clicks an ad extension and the resulting conversion to the keyword associated with the ad in which the extension is included. No cost or click data at the extension level is available in Search, Social, & Commerce. However, in [the [!UICONTROL Transaction Report]](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/management/basic-advanced/transaction-report.md), you can tell if a transaction resulted from a sitelink (rather than from the ad itself) when the value in the Link Type column is listed as `sl:<Sitelink text>`, such as sl:See Current Offers.

In [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft速 Advertising], you can see cost and click data on the [!DNL Ad Extensions] tab.
