# Manage [!DNL Google Ads] location extensions

A location extension shows your business address, clickable telephone number, and a map marker with your text ad. Ads that appear on mobile devices include a link with directions to your business. [!DNL Google Ads] location extensions use information from your [linked [!DNL Google My Business] account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404182).

You can create location extensions at both the campaign and ad group levels. When a campaign or ad group has multiple location extensions, the ad network displays the one that is closest to the user. You can optionally disable all location extensions for specific [!DNL Google Ads] campaigns and ad groups from the location extension settings.

## Performance data for location extensions

The ad network maps the clicks on a location extension to the keyword associated with the ad in which the extension is included.  No cost or click data at the extension level is available in Search, Social, & Commerce. In [!DNL Google Ads], you can see cost and click data on the [!DNL Campaigns] tab > [!DNL Ad Extensions] tab. Because location extensions have no URL to track, Search, Social, & Commerce can't report conversion data for them.
