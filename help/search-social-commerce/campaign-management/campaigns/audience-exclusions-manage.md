# Manage audience exclusions for your [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] campaigns and ad groups

*[!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] only*

You can exclude specific audiences as targets for specific ad groups and campaigns. Excluding an audience ensures that those people don't receive ads in the specified ad groups and campaigns.

For [!DNL Google Ads] accounts, you can exclude any audience type. For [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts, you can exclude only dynamic remarketing audiences.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Exclusions always override inclusions/targets.

You can also delete audience exclusions.
