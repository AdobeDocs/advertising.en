# About the [!UICONTROL Asset Library]

<!-- Combine with "Create" page into one page once you can do more than just create/upload. Or still combine them and rename this page; you can't really "manage" assets here, just create/upload and see a list of assets you've previously uploaded (including a preview), but not edit existing uploaded assets or anything on the ad network. -->

*For [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts only*

*Open beta feature*

In [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Asset Library], you can create reusable image, video, and (for [!DNL Google Ads] only) text assets and upload them to your [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] account-level asset libraries.

When you create or edit performance max campaigns in Advertising Search, you can select from all existing assets in your ad network-specific asset library (including the assets you've uploaded from here) for images, logos, and videos. You can also upload new assets.

<!--
Should all assets on the ad network be listed in Campaigns > Asset Library by now, or just ones created/uploaded from our UI? (Within perf max campaign settings, you can select from all in the ad network's asset library, which should include assets uploaded from our UI. But I'm not sure that this list here is the same.) If all, then mention when they're updated.
