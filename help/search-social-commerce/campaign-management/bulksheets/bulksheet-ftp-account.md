# Set up an FTP account for uploading bulksheets

You can optionally upload bulksheet files for supported ad networks to a specified FTP account for retrieval and automatic posting. The directory is scanned every hour, and new files are posted in the order in which they're received.

Retrieved bulksheet files, and any error files that are created during posting, are listed in the [!DNL Bulksheets] view.

>If you also upload inventory feed files via FTP, then use a separate FTP directory for bulksheet files.

1. Contact your Adobe Account Team to set up an FTP account for uploading bulksheet files.

   Your Adobe Account Team will provide you with the FTP location and your username and password.
