# Bulksheet errors

Search, Social, & Commerce generates two types of error files during bulksheet operations:

* **SE Errors:** When a file is posted but the ad network doesn't accept all of the data, an error file called `<uploaded file name>_se_errors.<extension used for the bulksheet>` is created. When some but not all rows were accepted, the error file shows the rows that weren't posted and an explanation of each error so you can correct it. The errors are included in the "[!UICONTROL SE Error Message]" column.

 >[!NOTE]
 >
 >If you post any [!DNL Google Ads] ads that violate the ad network's advertising policies but may be eligible for exemptions, then those ads are automatically reposted with exemption requests. If the exemption request fails, then information about the violation is included in the error file.

* **EF Errors:** When the bulksheet operation can't upload or process a file or individual rows in the file, it creates an error file called `<uploaded file name>_ef_errors.<extension used for the bulksheet>`. If the problem is with individual rows, then those rows are included,
with an explanation of each error so you can correct it. The errors are included in the "[!UICONTROL EF Error Message]" column.

## [!UICONTROL SE Error] messages

Errors in the [!UICONTROL SE Error] column come directly from the ad network.

## [!UICONTROL EF Error] messages

The following errors may be included in the [!UICONTROL EF Error] column in EF Errors files.
