# Remove label classification values from account components

Removing a classification value removes the association with the account component and all of its child components. Report data for the classification value is no longer available for those components. Removing a classification value doesn't delete the value nor the account components.

>[!NOTE]

>To delete a value from a label classification, see "[Delete label classification values](classification-values-delete.md)."
