# Remove campaigns from a portfolio

When you remove a campaign from a portfolio, Search, Social, & Commerce can't optimize bids, campaign budgets, and bid strategy targets for that campaign.

The action is logged in the portfolio's change history.

For more information about optimization, see the Optimization Guide, which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Optimization] > [!UICONTROL Portfolios]**, and then locate the portfolio.

   You can filter the portfolio list from the [!UICONTROL Portfolios] menu in the left panel by selecting a portfolio group or the [!UICONTROL Ungrouped Portfolios] node.

1. Next to the portfolio name, click ![View/edit settings button](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/settings.png "View/edit settings button") .

1. In the left menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**, and then remove the campaigns:

   * To remove all assigned campaigns, click ![Remove all campaigns from portfolio](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-remove-all.png "Remove all campaigns from portfolio").

   * To remove an individual campaign, click the campaign, and then either drag the campaign into the [!UICONTROL Available Campaigns] list or click ![Remove campaign from portfolio](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-remove.png "Remove campaign from portfolio") .

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
