# Remove campaigns from a portfolio

When you remove a campaign from a portfolio, Search, Social, & Commerce can't optimize bids, campaign budgets, and bid strategy targets for that campaign.

The action is logged in the portfolio's change history.

For more information about optimization, see the Optimization Guide, which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce.
