## General requirements for all ad networks

>[!NOTE]
>
>See each ad network's policy on acceptable ad copy for the full requirements.

* Use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

* All wide characters and double-byte characters reduce the number of characters permitted per line.

* Capitalizing the first letter in each word of your ad is allowed. But a word can't appear in all capital letters to draw attention unless that's how a term is trademarked. For example, "MAC" is allowed for a MAC brand ad, but "NEW" isn't allowed.

* Exclamation points are prohibited in headlines/titles, but they're allowed in description lines. Only one is allowed in the description.

* Special characters such as `@,~,\, ^,>,<` are prohibited.

* Shortcuts, or the use of symbols to replace words, are prohibited. For example, you can't use "U" to replace "you," or "`@`" to replace "at." 

* Superlative phrases, such as "Best"' or "#1," are prohibited unless this distinction has been verified by a third party and the verification is clearly displayed on your website.

* Use trademark terms only if your client owns the trademarks in question, and the trademarked items must be visible on the landing page.
 
* Inappropriate language is prohibited.

## Recommendations for effective ads

* Write powerful headlines to attract potential customers.

* Include keywords in your headline because that's what most people are looking for. [1]

* Create ad copy that's designed for the intended audience.

* Create ads that are specific, clearly communicate your intent, and include your company's value proposition to compel the user to click the ad and visit your site.

* Include the product, service, and other details (such as promotions) in the description/body.

* Get to the point fast: include the most relevant information about the business first.

* Relate your ad to offers that are on the landing page to help users complete the sales cycle.

* Use phrases like "Free Shipping," "Easy Returns," "Free Exchanges and In-store Returns," and "Free gifts" to increase the click-through rate.

* If you are offering a discount, then include the specific amount or percentage of the discount (such as "20% off" or "Save $20 on first purchase).

* If possible, use the keyword both in the headline/title and in both lines of the description/body. [1]

* Always include a call to action in the text, such as "View," "Check out," "Order," or "Sign up," to increase the click-through rate. For image ads, include the call to action on a button linking to your website; for rich media ads, include the call to action in an early frame.

* Be sensitive to how the advertiser wants its brand to be perceived. For example, an advertiser may not want the word "cheap" to show up in its ads.

* Research what your competitors are doing. Look at the top ads for a space (at sites like www.spyfu.com) and try to understand which ads are working.

[1]: If you use keyword insertion, use the correct capitalization for the insertion code:

`{keyword:default}` = lawn mowers

`{Keyword:default}` = Lawn mowers

`{KeyWord:default}` = Lawn Mowers

`{KEYWord:default}` = LAWN Mowers (which is allowed only if "LAWN" is a brand)

`{KeyWORD:default}` = Lawn MOWERS (which is allowed only if "MOWERS" is a brand)

`{KEYWORD:default}` = LAWN MOWERS (which is allowed only if "LAWN MOWERS" is a brand)
