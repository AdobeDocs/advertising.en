# What's new

The following features are new or recently changed. 

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 15 October 2025 |  [!UICONTROL Campaign Report] | (Opt-in feature) A new setting on the [!UICONTROL Columns] tab to "[!UICONTROL Include modeled conversions]" allows you to include data for modeled conversions in the report. Modeled conversions use data-driven estimates to account for conversions that can't be directly observed due to privacy restrictions, cookie limitations, or cross-device activity. Including them helps fill measurement gaps and provides more complete and accurate reporting.<br><br>The sub-option "[!UICONTROL Discrete columns for modeled conversions]" adds an additional column labeled "\<Conversion Name\> (MC)" after each conversion column in the report. When the option is disabled, modeled conversions are grouped with the measured conversions in one column, such as "\<Conversion Name\> (CT+VT+MC)." **Note:** The [!UICONTROL Conversion Attribution] settings also determine the types of conversions reported and how the conversion data is displayed.<br><br>To enable this feature, contact your Adobe Account Team. | See "[Report columns for basic and advanced reports](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/management/basic-advanced/basic-advanced-report-columns.md)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | Search, Social, & Commerce now syncs data for your existing search campaigns that use the [!DNL Google Ads] [!DNL AI Max] feature. Search campaign settings include the read-only settings "AI Max Enabled" and "AI Max Bundling," and ad group settings include the read-only setting "AI Max Search Term Matching."<br><br>Campaign- and keyword-level data is available in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] and [!UICONTROL Keywords] views and in the [!UICONTROL Campaign Report] and [!UICONTROL Keyword Report]. Data within Search, Social, & Commerce and [!DNL Google Ads] matches at the keyword and campaign levels, including for manual CPC campaigns that use [!DNL AI Max]. The following optional data columns are available:<ul><li>The [!UICONTROL Campaigns] view: "[!UICONTROL AI Max]" with the value *[!UICONTROL Enabled]*, *[!UICONTROL Disabled]*, or *[!UICONTROL NA]* (not applicable), and "[!UICONTROL AI Max Bundling]" with the values *[!UICONTROL Not Required]*, *[!UICONTROL Required]*, *[!UICONTROL Unknown]*, or *[!UICONTROL Unspecified]*.</li></li><li>The [!UICONTROL Campaign Report]: "[!UICONTROL AI Max Enabled]" with the value *[!UICONTROL false]* or null, and "[!UICONTROL AI Max Bundling Required]" with the value *[!UICONTROL NOT_REQUIRED]* or null</li><li>The [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] view: "[!UICONTROL AI Max Search Term Matching]" with the value *[!UICONTROL Disabled]* or *[!UICONTROL Enabled]*</li><li>The [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] view: "[!UICONTROL AI Max Search Term Matching]" with the value *[!UICONTROL true]* or null</li></li><br><br>For advertisers with [!DNL Analytics for Adobe Advertising], campaign-level data is available in [!DNL Analytics]. Data in [!DNL Analytics] may be slightly different than the data in [!DNL Google Ads] because [!DNL Analytics] uses a keyword-level data rollup and doesn't receive [!DNL AI Max] contribution data from [!DNL Google Ads].<br><br>Optimization support will be available in a future release. If you want to test [!DNL AI Max] before then, remove the campaigns from optimized portfolios and manage them manually or through a [!DNL Google Ads] portfolio. | See "[[!DNL Google Ads] campaign settings](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-google.md)," "[[!DNL Google Ads] ad group settings](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/ad-group-settings-google.md)," and "[Basic and advanced report columns](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/management/basic-advanced/basic-advanced-report-columns.md)." |
| 23 September 2025 | New user interface | The new user interface was reorganized, and a few menu options moved. You can now open most features in the legacy UI from the main menu in the new UI. Links to features in the legacy user interface show link indicators. If necessary, you can still easily switch between the new UI and the legacy UI.<br><br>The following features were moved as part of the redesign:<ul><li>The [!UICONTROL Objectives] view was moved from the [!UICONTROL Plan] section to the [!UICONTROL Goals] section.</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dashboard] is now a section, and your cross-portfolio performance visualizations are now at [!UICONTROL Dashboard] > [!UICONTROL Overview]. | See ""[How the user interface is organized](/help/search-social-commerce/getting-started/user-interface.md)" and "[Switch between the new and legacy user interfaces](/help/search-social-commerce/getting-started/ui-switch.md)." |
|  |  | Buttons to assign campaigns to portfolios and to assign/unassign campaigns and ad groups to constraints are now available in a floating bulk actions toolbar near the bottom of the data table.<br><br>![Bulk actions toolbar](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/ui-bulk-actions-toolbar.png "Bulk actions toolbar") | See "[Assign campaigns to a portfolio](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/advertising/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaign-assign-to-portfolio)," "[Manage constraint assignments for campaigns](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/manage/campaigns/campaign-constraint-assignments-manage.md)," and "[Manage constraint assignments for ad groups](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/manage/ad-groups/ad-group-constraint-assignments-manage.md) ." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Objectives] | In the legacy user interface, the [!UICONTROL Objectives] view was removed, and the [!UICONTROL New Objectives Beta] view is now called [!UICONTROL Objectives].<br><br>In the new user interface, the newer view was already called [!UICONTROL Objectives]. | See "[About objectives](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/goals/objectives/objective-about.md)." |
| 17 September 2025 | Campaign Management | Search, Social, & Commerce now automatically syncs your [!DNL Google Ads] app campaigns with ad-level data, including [!DNL Google Ads]-tracked conversions for app install ads. The Campaign Type values in reports and views are [!UICONTROL App Campaign], [!UICONTROL App Campaign for Engagement], and [!UICONTROL App Campaign for Pre Registration], and the Ad Type values are [!UICONTROL App Ad], [!UICONTROL App Engagement Ad], and [!UICONTROL App Preregistration Ad]. Ad-level standard metrics &mdash; but not Google Ads-tracked conversions &mdash; are available in Adobe Analytics.<br><br>Optimization support isn't yet available. | See "[Supported inventory](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Portfolios] | (Beta feature) The new user interface now has support to create and manage portfolio groups. | See "[Manage portfolio groups](/help/search-social-commerce/new-ui/manage/portfolios/portfolio-group-manage.md)." |
| | [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] | (Beta feature) You can now edit the entity name, status, budget (campaigns), and bid (ad groups) within a row in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Ad Groups] views. | See "[Edit settings directly within a row](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/settings-edit-within-row.md)." |
| 30 July 2025 | [!DNL Google Ads] [!DNL AI Max] feature | [!DNL Google Ads] has introduced [!DNL AI Max] as an enhancement to existing search campaign types. While these campaigns continue to function within [!DNL Google Ads] and appear in Search, Social, & Commerce, the [!DNL Google Ads] API doesn't yet support [!DNL AI Max]. As a result, when this feature is enabled, we've observed discrepancies and missing data in reporting, leading to inconsistencies in performance analysis and optimization.<br><br>Once [!DNL Google Ads] adds [!DNL AI Max] support to their API in the coming months, Search, Social, & Commerce will implement it. The upgrade will allow us to properly detect and support AI Max-enabled campaigns, and reassess the data issues to resume full reporting and optimization of these campaigns.<br><br>**Recommendation:** Until full API support is available, we strongly recommend not opting into [!DNL AI Max] for campaigns optimized through Search, Social, & Commerce. This will help ensure that your reporting remains accurate and actionable and that optimization is based on the correct data. If you have any campaigns that aren't optimized through Search, Social, & Commerce that use [!DNL AI Max], then use data within [!DNL Google Ads] for analysis and pacing. | &mdash; |
| 2 July 2025 | Login | Search, Social, & Commerce is transitioning to the Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for login authentication. IMS provides single sign-On (SSO) access to all [!DNL Adobe] products that support IMS, including Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Target, and Analytics. You can now use one [!DNL Adobe ID] to sign in across [!DNL Adobe] products from either the Experience Cloud sign-in page or the legacy Search, Social, & Commerce sign-in page. Your current Search, Social, & Commerce credentials will remain active for a short period so that you can prepare for the change. | See "[Sign in](/help/search-social-commerce/getting-started/sign-in.md)."<br><br>For more information about the Experience Cloud interface, including managing your user profile, see "[Experience Cloud interface and administration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/experience-cloud)." |
| Released 21 June 2025 | [!UICONTROL Objectives] | Objective uploads to [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] now occur throughout the day, sometimes even hourly, instead of daily as before. For advertisers with large accounts or custom configurations, uploads occur at least three times daily.<br><br>The increased frequency enables the ad networks' smart bidding systems to respond to intraday trends on seasonal or special event days. | See "[Enable uploading of objectives to ad networks](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/objective-upload-to-networks.md)." |
| 26 March 2025 | [!UICONTROL Tracking], [!DNL Adobe Analytics for Advertising] | (Advertisers with [!DNL Adobe Analytics for Advertising] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts) For accounts with the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] tracking option, the format of the AMO ID parameter in the landing page suffixes for all campaign types was updated to the latest format. Previously, performance max campaigns for most accounts were migrated to the new format.<br><br>For accounts without the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] tracking option that weren't already migrated to the new format, however, you must manually update each landing page suffix to include the new AMO ID format.<br><br>Current format: `s_kwcid=AL!{userid}!10!{AdId}!!!!{OrderItemId}!!{CampaignId}!{AdGroupId}` | See "[Overview of [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/overview.md)" and the [AMO ID formats](/help/integrations/analytics/ids.md#amo-id-formats)." |
| February 2025 | [!UICONTROL Campaign Management] | Search, Social, & Commerce now syncs product ads and video ads for [!DNL Google Ads] demand gen campaigns (previously called discovery campaigns). Reports in Search, Social, & Commerce and in Adobe Analytics (for advertisers with [!DNL Adobe Analytics for Advertising]) now include ad-level performance and spend data for all available ad types.  In the [!UICONTROL Ads] view and in the [!UICONTROL Ad Variation Report], you can filter the [!UICONTROL Creative Type] column to include [!UICONTROL Demand Gen Image Ad], [!UICONTROL Demand Gen Carousel Ad], [!UICONTROL Demand Gen Product Ad], and [!UICONTROL Demand Gen Video Ad].<br><br>Objective upload support is available for all of the supported ad types. Optimization for product ads and video ads isn't fully supported yet. | For more information:  See "[Supported Inventory](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md)." |
| 5 December 2024 | [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] offline conversions | The following support is now available for [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] enhanced conversions for offline conversions, which you can use for conversion events without click IDs, such as telephone sales that result from website leads.<ul><li>Search, Social, & Commerce syncs your existing enhanced conversions goals for offline conversions so you can use them for reporting and optimization. The data is synced daily at 05:00 in the advertiser's time zone.</li><li>You can upload your first-party, offline conversion data mapped to your existing enhanced conversions goals.</li></li></ul>Create the enhanced conversion goals for leads within [!DNL Microsoft Advertising]. | See "[Implement [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] enhanced conversions for offline conversions](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/special-workflows/microsoft-enhanced-conversions.md) " for an outline of the workflow and "[Upload offline conversion data for enhanced conversions](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/conversion-metrics/upload-data-offline-conversions.md)." |
| 29 October 2024 | [!DNL Adobe Analytics for Advertising] | (Advertisers with [!DNL Adobe Analytics for Advertising] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] performance max campaigns) Asset group-level data for your performance max campaigns is now available in Adobe Analytics when you implement a new AMO ID ([!DNL s_kwcid]) parameter in the tracking URLs for your performance max campaigns, which don't include ads and keywords. Tracking for most accounts with performance max campaigns was already migrated to the new format. For accounts with performance max campaigns without the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] tracking option that weren't already migrated to the new format, however, you must manually update each landing page suffix to include the new AMO ID format.<br><br>Adobe Analytics data for your performance max campaigns is also available in Search, Social, & Commerce. | See the new [AMO ID format](/help/integrations/analytics/ids.md#amo-id-formats) and [when and how to add the parameter to your tracking URLs](/help/integrations/analytics/ids.md#amo-id-implement). |
| | [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | For each performance max and search campaign, you can now choose whether to allow [!DNL Google Ads] to bid higher for new customers, bid only for new customers, or bid equally for new and existing customers. To bid higher for new customers, you must first activate the new customer acquisition goal for your [!DNL Google Ads] account or manager account using [!DNL Google Ads]. The goal definition includes the eligible existing customer lists and the additional conversion value for new customers. | See "[[!DNL Google Ads] Campaign Settings](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings-google.md)."<br><br> See also the [!DNL Google Ads] help "[About the new customer acquisition goal](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12080169)" and Steps 1-2 in "[Activate the new customer acquisition goal](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14007601)." |
| 3 September 2024 | [!DNL Google Ads] conversions | The following support is now available for [!DNL Google Ads] enhanced conversions for leads, which you can use for offline conversion events for which click IDs (`gclid` values) are unavailable, such as to track telephone sales that result from website leads.<ul><li>Search, Social, & Commerce syncs your existing enhanced conversions for leads so you can use them for reporting and optimization. The data is synced daily at 05:00 in the advertiser's time zone.</li><li>You can create conversion actions for enhanced conversions for leads.</li><li>You can upload your first-party, offline conversion data mapped to your enhanced conversions for leads.</li></li></ul>You must create and implement a conversion tag for enhanced conversions for leads separately within Google. | See "[Implement [!DNL Google Ads] enhanced conversions for leads](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/special-workflows/google-enhanced-conversions-leads.md)" for an outline of the workflow, "[Create a conversion action for a [!DNL Google Ads] enhanced conversion for leads](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/conversion-metrics/conversion-action-google.md)," and "[Upload offline conversion data for enhanced conversions](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/conversion-metrics/upload-data-offline-conversions.md)." |
| | [!UICONTROL Campaigns]<br>[!UICONTROL Reports] | ([!DNL Google Ads] performance max campaigns) New features provide information and data for asset groups:<ul><li>Two read-only information fields are available in the settings for existing asset groups in each performance max campaign:<ul><li>**[!UICONTROL Primary Status]:** Why the asset group is or isn't serving at full capacity. It takes into account the asset group status as well as other signals, such as policy and quality approvals.</li><li>**[!UICONTROL Primary Status Reason]:** Additional details about the asset group's primary status.</li></ul></li><li>A new specialty report, [!UICONTROL Google Asset Group Performance Report], gives performance data for asset groups in performance max campaigns within a specified account.

| 29 April 2024 | Objective Upload | The objective upload feature for hybrid portfolios now uploads conversion data by Search, Social, & Commerce objective instead of by portfolio, and the conversion naming format for new uploads has changed. You can now move a campaign to another portfolio with the same objective without needing to change its conversion goals.</li></ul>If you've enabled this feature, your existing data will be migrated using the new upload format per the schedule shared by your Adobe Account Team. During the migration period, both the old and new format uploads run in parallel. Modelling and optimization aren't affected because the new conversion actions appear initially with "secondary" (not optimized) status and with 90 days of backfill data. | See "[Enable uploading of objectives to ad networks](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/objective-upload-to-networks.md)." |
