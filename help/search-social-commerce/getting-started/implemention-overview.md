# Overview of implementing Search, Social, & Commerce

[!DNL Adobe] or one of its affiliate agencies works with each advertiser to launch its online advertising portfolios and to track any additional ad campaigns. After the initial launch, additional ongoing tasks ensure that the advertiser's goals will continue to be met.

The following is the general workflow for implementing and using Search, Social, & Commerce.

## Initial Launch

[!DNL Adobe] and/or your agency work with you do the following:

1. Evaluate your high-level business goals and devise strategies to achieve them:

   1. Identify your business model and marketing objectives.
  
   1. Identify your conversion tracking requirements
  
   1. Analyze your existing online ad account structures.
  
   1. Identify metrics for portfolio optimization and reporting.

1. (Administrator or account manager users) Set up administrative accounts:

   1. Set up the advertiser's account. If an agency manages the advertiser's data, then the advertiser's account must be associated with the agency account.
  
   1. (If necessary) Create user accounts for the advertiser to view and manage its campaign data and to generate reports.

   For details about setting up accounts, see the help chapter on "Admin."

1. Synchronize with, or create, campaigns for each of your ad network accounts:

   * Synchronize with the account by a) creating a corresponding account record in Search, Social, & Commerce that contains the account access credentials and tracking options and b) setting the account status to enabled.
  
   * If the accounts don't already contain campaign data, then add campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, and placements from within Search, Social, & Commerce or from within the ad network.
   
     For details about setting up search campaigns, see the help chapter on "Campaign Management."

1. Set up tracking for all ads for which you want Adobe Advertising to track conversions:

   1. (If necessary) Set up click tracking for ads, and optionally for keywords, [!DNL Google Ads] placements, and [!DNL Google Ads] extensions by generating and uploading click-tracking URLs.
   
      Click tracking URLs for advertisers with the Adobe Advertising pixel-based conversion tracking service include a redirect to [!DNL Adobe] servers.
  
   1. Set up conversion tracking. Depending on the implementation, this may involve adding conversion tracking tags to the appropriate webpages and/or setting up a daily feed drop for conversion data that you've collected using your own method.
   
      For details about setting up tracking, see the help chapter on "Tracking."

1. Set up integrations with additional products:

    1. (Advertisers with Adobe Analytics and/or Adobe Audience Manager) Set up integrations between the various accounts so that Adobe Advertising can exchange data with them.
    
       See the guide on "[Integrations with Experience Cloud](/help/integrations/home.md)."
    
    1. (Advertisers with [!DNL Google Analytics]) Sync conversion metrics for a [!DNL Google Analytics] account, property, and view combination for optimization and reporting.
    
       See the help subchapter "Admin" > "[Configuring Data Sources](/help/search-social-commerce/admin/data-sources/data-source-about.md)."

1. Set up and launch portfolios:

   1. Set up portfolios configured to meet your objective and business goals, with the appropriate campaigns. The implementation team then gathers and validates click and revenue data for at least 14 days and validates the portfolio settings.
   
      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Search, Social, & Commerce still tracks and reports data for campaigns that aren't assigned to portfolios, but it does't optimize bids for them.

   1. After enough data is available to create a baseline, then the team can launch the portfolio &mdash; allowing Search, Social, & Commerce to optimize bids and/or budgets for the portfolio, based on the optimization type.
   
   For details about setting up and launching portfolios, see the help on "Optimization," which is available from the [!UICONTROL Help] menu (![Help menu](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/help-main-menu.png "Help menu")) in the upper right of any page within Search, Social, & Commerce.

1. Monitor your portfolios' performance:

   1. Generate advertising insights, which are visual, actionable data about your optimized and active portfolios.
  
   1. Set up, and potentially automate, customized reports for performance monitoring.
   
   For details about running advertising insights and setting up reports, see the help chapter on "Insights & Reports."

1.  (Optional) Configure your [performance data views](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/data-views/data-views-about.md) to show the data that you want to see.

## Ongoing Tasks

After the initial launch, the following ongoing tasks are required. Depending on your terms of engagement, either [!DNL Adobe], an affiliate agency, or the advertiser performs these tasks:

* Continue to monitor and analyze the performance of each portfolio by viewing alerts, performance data for each portfolio and its component campaigns, customizable reports, and (some roles) simulations.

* Adjust the various strategies and settings that you use to manage the portfolio set, as necessary, based on the portfolio's actual and predicted performance and opportunities for growth:

  * Adjust the portfolio budgets, objectives, and other settings.
  
  * Adjust account/campaign structures to accommodate changes in marketing strategy.
  
  * Add/pause/delete campaign components. This may include expanding keyword sets based on search term analysis, and testing ad copy and landing pages.
  
  * Update geographical- and site-targeting strategies based on advanced performance reports.
  
  * (Optional) Add bidding constraints to individual search keywords or to all keywords in an ad group, campaign, or portfolio.
  
  * Add new portfolios.
  
For instructions on monitoring portfolios and adjusting the portfolio strategies, see the help subchapter "Optimization" > "Managing Portfolios" > "Monitoring and Managing Performance," which is available from the [!UICONTROL Help] menu (![Help menu](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/help-main-menu.png "Help menu")) in the upper right of any page within Search, Social, & Commerce.
