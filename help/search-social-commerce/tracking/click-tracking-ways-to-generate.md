# When and how to generate click-tracking URLs by ad network and object

The following table explains how to generate click-tracking URLs for the various campaign components.

| Ad Network | Component | How to Generate a Click-tracking URL |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [!DNL Baidu], [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Microsoft Advertising], [!DNL Yahoo! Japan Ads], and [!DNL Yandex] | <ul><li>text ads</li><li>keywords</li><li>([!DNL Google Ads] content campaigns) placements</li><li>([!DNL Google Advertising] and [!DNL Advertising]) sitelinks</li></ul> | When the tracking settings for an active campaign include the options "[!UICONTROL EF Redirect]" and "[!UICONTROL Auto Upload]" (either set at the campaign level or inherited from the account settings), you don't need to generate tracking URLs for the ad group components. Search, Social, & Commerce automatically creates and uploads the following types of tracking URLs to the ad network each time it synchronizes with it: a) (accounts with final URLs) Search, Social, & Commerce tracking parameters for tracking templates and the same parameters appended to the final URLs, b) (accounts with destination URLs) new destination URLs embedded with Search, Social, & Commerce tracking code, and c) (Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising accounts) landing page suffix (final URL suffix) parameters.<br><br>If the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] option is disabled, then you can generate tracking URLs for a component in any of the following ways:<ul><li>([!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Microsoft Advertising], [!DNL Yahoo! Ads], and [!DNL Yandex]) When you post ads from feed files, select the [!UICONTROL Generate Tracking URLs] option. You can optionally validate the tracking template fields in any bulksheet file before you post it to the ad network.</li><li>When you download, upload, or post a bulksheet file containing the component, select the [!UICONTROL Generate Tracking URLs] option. For accounts with destination URLs, you can optionally validate the Base URL/Final URL fields fields before you post the file to the ad network</li><li>Use the [[!UICONTROL Tracking URLs] tool](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/click-tracking-url-generate.md) to generate a tracking URL and manually add it to the appropriate [!UICONTROL Tracking Template] or [!UICONTROL Base URL] field. <b>Note:</b> The tracking templates you generate don't include any additional tracking parameters specified in the account or campaign settings.<ul><li>Google accounts) Go to the [[!UICONTROL Tracking URLs] tool](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/click-tracking-url-generate.md), copy the on-screen value in the appropriate [!UICONTROL Tracking Template] field, and manually add the entire tracking string to the component settings. You must add a [!DNL Google Ads] [!DNL ValueTrack] parameter for the final URL after the `&url=` parameter (such as `{lpurl}`). For a list of [!DNL ValueTrack] parameters to indicate final URLs in tracking templates, see the "Tracking template only" parameters in the section on "Available [!DNL ValueTrack] Parameters" in the [[!DNL Google Ads] documentation]9https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375447.</li><li>(Other accounts with final URLs) Generate a tracking URL using the [[!UICONTROL Tracking URLs] tool](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/click-tracking-url-generate.md), and manually add the entire tracking string to the component settings. You must add a parameter for the final URL after the `&url=` parameter (such as `{lpurl}`). For [!DNL Yahoo! Japan Ads] accounts, use the parameter `{lpurl}`. For a list of [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] parameters to indicate final URLs in tracking templates, see the [Microsoft Advertising documentation](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799).</li><li>(Accounts with destination URLs) Generate a tracking URL using the [[!UICONTROL Tracking URLs] tool](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/click-tracking-url-generate.md), and manually add the tracking URL in the appropriate [!UICONTROL Base URL] field.</li></ul></li></ul><b>Notes:</b><br><br><ul><li>(Accounts with final URLs) The tracking template at the most granular level is used (for example, a keyword-level tracking template overrides the account-, campaign- and ad group-level templates, and tracking templates for keywords and placements override those for the associated ad).</li><li>Adobe Advertising maps clicks and resulting revenue from sitelinks to the keyword associated with the ad in which the sitelink is included, not separately. See "[Supported inventory](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md)."</li></ul><b>Tip:</b> (Accounts with final URLs) Tracking is easiest to manage if you create tracking templates at only the highest level necessary &mdash; for example, account- or campaign-level tracking templates to apply the same tracking to all entities in the account or campaign. |

| [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] | product ads | <ul><li>[!DNL Microsoft Merchant Center] accounts: Manually create a tracking URL for each product in your [!DNL Microsoft Merchant Center] account using the [tracking template format for shopping ads](/help/search-social-commerce/tracking/formats-click-tracking-microsoft.md), and manually add it to the [!UICONTROL Tracking Template] field in the account, campaign, or product group settings.<br><br>Alternately, you can add the tracking URL to the product data within the [!DNL Microsoft Merchant Center account]. To do so, include the tracking URL, together with the value in the "[!DNL link]" or "[!DNL mobile_link]" fields, as appropriate, in a [custom column "[!DNL bingads_redirect]" within the product feed](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51084). The value in the "[!DNL bingads_redirect]" field replaces the values in the "[!DNL link]" and "[!DNL mobile_link]" fields. URLs generated using this method don't include any tracking parameters specified in the account settings.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The account-level and campaign-level feature to automatically upload tracking during sync doesn't generate tracking for new [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] product groups. A workaround is to generate tracking when you upload or post a bulksheet.</li><li>[!DNL Google Merchant Center] accounts: Generate tracking URLs using the [[!UICONTROL Tracking URLs] tool](/help/search-social-commerce/tools/click-tracking-url-generate.md), and manually add them to the [!UICONTROL Tracking Template] fields in the account, campaign, or product group settings.</li></ul> |
