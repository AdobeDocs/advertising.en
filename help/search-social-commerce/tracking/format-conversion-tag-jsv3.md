<script type='text/javascript'>
    (function() {
        var f = function() {
              EF.init({ eventType: "transaction",
                        transactionProperties : "ev_property=<property name>&ev_transid=<transid>",
                        segment : "",

        if (window.EF.main) {
            f();

        window.EF.onloadCallbacks[window.EF.onloadCallbacks.length] = f;
        if (!window.EF.jsTagAdded) {
            var efjs = document.createElement('script'); efjs.type = 'text/javascript'; efjs.async = true;
            efjs.src = 'https://www.everestjs.net/static/st.v3.js';
            var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(efjs, s);

where:

* `<ef-userid>` is a unique, numeric user ID that Search, Social, & Commerce assigns to the advertiser.

* `<propertyname>` is the conversion that will be tracked. For example, if you're tracking a conversion called "registration," then the tag would include the parameter `ev_registration=<registration>`, and you would need to pass the actual revenue for each transaction (such as `ev_registration=1`). When multiple properties are tracked, they're joined by an ampersand (`&`), such as `ev_registration=<registration>&ev_sale=<sale>` (for example, `ev_registration=1&ev_sale=12.99`). **Note:**  The property name may not include special characters.

* `<transid>` is a unique transaction ID (such as an actual order ID) that the advertiser generates and passes to identify a transaction. It's included only when the "[!UICONTROL Include unique transaction IDs]" option is selected.

  Search, Social, & Commerce uses the transaction ID to eliminate duplicate transactions with the same transaction ID and property value. The transaction ID is included in the [!UICONTROL Transaction Report], which you can use to validate data within Adobe Advertising with the advertiser's data. **Note:** If the advertiser's data doesn't include a unique ID per transaction, then Search, Social, & Commerce still generates one based on transaction time.
