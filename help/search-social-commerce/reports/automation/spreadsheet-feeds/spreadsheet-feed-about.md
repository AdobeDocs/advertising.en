# About spreadsheet report feeds

*For basic reports and model accuracy reports only*

Spreadsheet feeds provide daily performance data for all basic reports and model accuracy reports in a custom spreadsheet format in [!DNL MicrosoftÂ® Excel] XLSX. You can set up spreadsheet feeds using specially formatted [!DNL Excel] spreadsheet templates that you create from regular report templates. Each day, the spreadsheet is automatically refreshed at a specified time with new, raw data that is aggregated daily. The raw data populates any columns and graphs that you've included in the spreadsheet template. Once a spreadsheet feed file is available, or if the file generation fails, each email recipient in the report template receives notification, based on the user's configured [notification settings for reports](/help/search-social-commerce/notifications/notification-about.md).

You can configure the feed to refresh up to the last 90 days of data, and all previous existing data remains, continuing to accumulate.

The [!UICONTROL Spreadsheets Feeds] view lists all spreadsheet feeds that you have created. From this view, you can create spreadsheet feeds, manually refresh a feed, or delete a feed.
