# Create a spreadsheet report feed

*For basic reports and model accuracy reports only*

Set up spreadsheet feeds using specially formatted [!DNL Excel] spreadsheet templates that you create from regular report templates.

1. [Create the [!DNL Excel] template to populate with the report data](spreadsheet-feed-create-excel-template.md).

2. Create the spreadsheet feed:
   
   1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search, Social, & Commerce] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Spreadsheet Feeds]**.
   
   1. In the toolbar above the data table, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
   
   1. In the **[!UICONTROL Add Spreadsheet Feed]** dialog, specify the [spreadsheet feed settings](spreadsheet-feed-settings.md).
   
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.
   
   1. (Optional) Once the feed's [!UICONTROL Update Status] is *[!UICONTROL Finished]*, click **[!UICONTROL XLSX]** next to the feed, and then open or save the file according to your browser's normal procedure.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If the report template associated with the feed is later deleted, then the feed is also deleted.

      The spreadsheet feeds are automatically refreshed each day at the configured [!UICONTROL Schedule Time]. If the report template includes addresses for any email recipients, then those addresses receive notifications when the spreadsheet is refreshed.
