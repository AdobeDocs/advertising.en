# Edit a report template

You can change the settings for any report template you created. The new settings are applied to any reports using the template that are generated in the future.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Reports]**.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** tab.

1. Click the template name.

1. Change the report settings.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > When you edit the settings, you don't need to select the check box next to "[!UICONTROL Save as template]" in the [!UICONTROL Scheduling and Delivery] section. Doing so prompts you to create a new template with a different name.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Update Template]**.
