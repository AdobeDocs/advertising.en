# [!UICONTROL RSA Asset Report]

The [!UICONTROL RSA Asset Report] includes daily impression metrics for each asset ([!UICONTROL Creative Title] or [!UICONTROL Description]) for the responsive search ads (RSAs) in one or more portfolios or one or more accounts, campaigns, and ad groups. By default, data includes one row for each asset that received at least one impression in the specified data range, even if the asset was disabled (removed) during the reporting period. The rows are in ascending order by ad group by default. The report can optionally include label classifications.
