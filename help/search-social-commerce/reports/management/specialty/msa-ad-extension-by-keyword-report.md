# [!UICONTROL MSA Ad Extension by Keyword Report]

*[!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts only*

This report shows the impressions, clicks, spend, and average cost per click of each ad extension and click type by keyword. Use this report to compare the performance of your ad extensions for each keyword.

When you run a report with only metric columns and no dimensions, then the generated report contains two duplicate rows: one with aggregated data and the other with all metrics.<!-- all metrics? -->

You can view data for the last 180 days. Search, Social, & Commerce pulls the data from [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] in real time, and it may take several minutes to generate reports with larger data volume.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the report includes a large volume of data, the report may fail. If this happens, run the report for a smaller time interval.
