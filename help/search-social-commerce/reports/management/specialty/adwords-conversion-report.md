# [!UICONTROL AdWords Conversion Report]

*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts with [!DNL Google Ads] conversion optimization only*

The [!UICONTROL AdWords Conversion Report] includes cost, click, and impression data; conversion data by conversion type tracked by the [!DNL Google Ads Conversion Optimizer]; and (optionally) derived metric data for one or more accounts, campaigns, ad groups, ads, or keywords. Data is shown only when the [!DNL Google Ads Conversion Optimizer] is enabled in the campaign's bidding settings (and thus Search, Social, & Commerce isn't optimizing bids for the campaign). By default, the data includes one row for each conversion for each applicable keyword for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order by ad group name and then by keyword by default. The report doesn't include cost, click, or impression data, nor any conversion data tracked by [!DNL Adobe].

You can view data for the previous two months.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data for this report is pulled for the previous day at 23:00 (11:00 p.m.) each day. For example, at 23:00 on June 18, it pulls data for June 17. If you run the report on June 19 at 09:00 &mdash; before data for June 18 is pulled &mdash; then report includes data through June 17 at 23:00.
