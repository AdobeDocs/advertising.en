# [!UICONTROL AdWords Shopping Performance Report]

*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts only*

The [!UICONTROL AdWords Shopping Performance Report] includes cost, click, and impression data; converted click and conversion data tracked by the [!DNL Google Ads Conversion Optimizer]; and (optionally) conversion data tracked by [!DNL Adobe] and derived metric data aggregated at the product ID level for one or more ad groups in shopping campaigns. By default, the data includes one row for each product ID and product category per ad group for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order by account name, campaign name, and then ad group name by default.

You can view data for the previous two months. Data before 21 September 2018 may be shown in two rows: one row with cost and click data, and one row with conversion data tracked by Adobe. Subsequent data is shown on one row.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* If the product includes the [!UICONTROL Product Category] column, and a product appears in multiple categories, then the product appears in multiple rows, and the conversion count is duplicated in each of the applicable rows. Because the conversion data totals aren't accurate, sort the data by category only for a general understanding of how conversions are trending by category.
>* Data for this report is pulled for the previous day at 23:00 (11:00 p.m.) each day. For example, at 23:00 on June 18, it pulls data for June 17. If you run the report on June 19 at 09:00 &mdash; before data for June 18 is pulled &mdash; then report includes data through June 17 at 23:00.
