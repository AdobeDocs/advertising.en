*[!DNL Google Ads] accounts only*

The [!UICONTROL AdWords Search Query Report] includes cost, click, impression, and (optionally) derived metric data for user search query terms for one or more ad groups. By default, the data includes one row for each search term that resulted in impressions or clicks for each applicable ad group for each time unit in the specified date range, and the rows are in ascending order by ad group name and then by search term. You can optionally include the keyword to which the search term was matched. The report doesn't include the keyword to which the search term was matched, nor any conversion data tracked by [!DNL Adobe].
