# Specialty report settings

| Tab | Parameter | Description |
|----|----|----|
| n/a | [!UICONTROL Name] | (Optional) A name for the report and for the template (if you save the report as a template). If you apply an existing template, the template name is filled in by default. If you don't apply a template or enter a name, then the report is named `<client name>-<date and time>-<report type>` (such as "acme - Apr 3, 2009 11:25:19 AM PDT - Keyword") by default.<br><br>You can optionally enter a custom name, but don't use a file extension.<br><br>If you're creating a template to [send reports to an FTP directory](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/automation/ftp-reports.md), then you can optionally include "CSV" (in uppercase letters) anywhere in the file name to create files in CSV format rather than the default TSV format. See [file name requirements for reports sent to an FTP directory](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/automation/ftp-reports.md). |
|  | [!UICONTROL Save as template] | (Optional unless you want to run the report according to a schedule) Saves the report settings as a template, which is available in the [!UICONTROL Reports] > [!UICONTROL Report Templates] view and can be reused to create new reports. To save the report as a template, select the check box.<br><br>To run the report according to a schedule, you must save the settings as a template.<br><br><b>Note:</b> You can save the current set of parameters as a new template even if it's based on an existing template. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Type] | The report type to generate. |
| [!UICONTROL Basic  Settings] | [!UICONTROL Template] | (Optional) A report template to apply, which pre-populates the report options according to the template. All templates saved for the report type and available to you are listed.<br><br>If you select a template, you can still change the report options, and you can even save the report as a new template. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Data Aggregation] | ([!UICONTROL Forecast Accuracy Report only]) The time unit that should be represented on each row of the report: <i>[!UICONTROL Summary (the default)]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Daily]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Weekly]</i> (and then specify the first day of the week), <i>[!UICONTROL Monthly]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Quarterly]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Yearly]</i>, or <i>[!UICONTROL Day of Week]</i> (basic reports only).<br><br>The report shows one row for each keyword or other item for each time unit in the specified date range. For example, if you select <i>[!UICONTROL Summary]</i> and a date range of <i>[!UICONTROL Last 7 Days]</i> for a keyword report, the report includes one row for each keyword, each summarizing the totals and averages across the seven days. The same report with <i>[!UICONTROL Daily]</i> data aggregation includes one row for each keyword for each of the last seven days (seven rows per keyword).<br><br><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>When you aggregate data hourly, using either the "[!UICONTROL Hourly]" or "[!UICONTROL Day of Week (Hourly)]" aggregation:</li><ul><li>You can view up to the last 14 days of data. The report shows data by hour on a 24-hour clock. "[!UICONTROL 0]" includes 00:01-00:59 (12:01-12:59 a.m.) and "[!UICONTROL 23]" includes 23:01-23:59 (11:01-11:59 p.m.) in the advertiser's time zone.</li><li>The "[!UICONTROL Device]" column isn't supported.</li><li>For the [!UICONTROL Ad Group Report], the "[!UICONTROL Data Based On]" option "[!UICONTROL Portfolio Configuration During the Specified Dates]" isn't supported.</li><li>For the [!UICONTROL Ad Group Report], you can base hourly data only on the current portfolio configuration (using the "[!UICONTROL Data Based On]" option "[!UICONTROL Current Portfolio Configuration]"), not the portfolio configuration during specified dates.</li></ul></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Conversions Based on] | ([!UICONTROL AdWords Shopping Performance Report], [!UICONTROL Campaign Daily Impression Share Report], and [!UICONTROL Keyword Daily Impression Share Report] only) How to report conversion data:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Transaction date]</i> (the default): To see transactions whose transaction date occurred during the specified time period. This option shows you how much revenue was earned within the specified time period.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Click date]:</i> To see transactions that resulted from a click that occurred during the specified time period. When a portfolio has significant delay between clicks and transactions, this option is useful for computing the historical revenue per click for the portfolio, which indicates the revenue behaviors to expect over time.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Date Range] | The date range for which to generate data:<ul><li><i>[Preset range]:</i> A list of common time increments, ranging from <i>[!UICONTROL Today]</i> to <i>[!UICONTROL Last 180 Days]</i>. The default is <i>[!UICONTROL Last 7 Days]</i>, which reports the last seven days for which data is available. <b>Note:</b> <i>[!UICONTROL Last Month]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Last 3 Months]</i>, and <i>[!UICONTROL Last 6 Months]</i> show data for the previous calendar months.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Custom Date Range]:</i> Specify the beginning date and end date. Enter dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY or M/D/YYYY, or click ![Calendar](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/calendar.png "Calendar") next to a field and select a date.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Compare With] | Compares data for the specified date range with data for a second date range. When you select this option, two additional columns are added for each regular data column. For example, instead of including just one column for "Impressions," the report includes columns for "[!UICONTROL Impressions Range 1]," "[!UICONTROL Impressions Range 2]," and "[!UICONTROL Impressions Difference]."<br><br><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>The difference column isn't shown for custom/derived metrics.</li><li>Reports that compare large date ranges take longer to generate.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Show Comparison Data as] | (When "[!UICONTROL Compare With]" is selected) How to express the difference between data in the two selected date ranges in the "[Data field] [!UICONTROL Difference]" column:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Variance]</i> (the default): Shows the difference as a numeric value.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL % Change]:</i> Shows the difference as a percentage.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Filter By] | ([!UICONTROL RSA Asset Report], [!UICONTROL Campaign Daily Impression Share Report], and [!UICONTROL Keyword Daily Impression Share Report] only) Whether to report on data for specific portfolios or for specific ad networks:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Portfolio]</i> (the default): To include data for campaigns in one or more portfolios.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Search Engine]:</i> To include data for campaigns in one or more ad networks, as applicable for the report type. |
|  | \[Primary Filters\] | The data components to include. If you don't make a selection, data for all portfolios (when applicable) or for all applicable ad networks and their subcomponents are included in the report. You optionally can narrow down the data to be reported by specifying individual components and subcomponents. Depending on the report type and (when applicable) whether you are filtering by portfolio or ad network, indicate the components to include:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Portfolio]:</i> One or more portfolios or their subcomponents (campaigns or ad groups). To select a component and all of its subcomponents, select the check box next to the component name. To select a subcomponent, select the check box next to the subcomponent name, and then click &gt;&gt; to move it to the [!UICONTROL Selected Filters] column. For example, to get data for Portfolio 1 and all of its campaigns and ad groups, select the check box next to Portfolio 1. To get data when at least one event occurred in Campaign 1 in Portfolio 1, expand Portfolio 1 and then select only the check box next to Campaign 1.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Search Engine]:</i> One or more ad networks or their subcomponents (accounts, campaigns, or ad groups). To select a component and all of its subcomponents, select the check box next to the component name, and then click &gt;&gt; to move it to the [!UICONTROL Selected Filters] column. To select a subcomponent, select the check box next to the subcomponent name, and then click &gt;&gt; to move it to the [!UICONTROL Selected Filters] column. For example, to get data when at least one event occurred in any [!DNL Google Ads] account, campaign, and ad group, select the check box next to [!DNL Google AdWords]. To get data only for Campaign 1 in [!DNL Google Ads] Account 1, expand [!DNL Google Ads] and then Account 1, and then select only the check box next to Campaign 1.</li></ul><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>To expand a component in the list (such as to list the accounts on an ad network), click ![right arrow icon](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/compressed-item.png "right arrow icon") next to the component.</li><li>To see what type of component any item is, hold your cursor over it.</li><li>By default, only a) active and optimized portfolios and their active components or b) active and enabled ad network accounts, campaigns, and their active components are listed. To view paused and deleted components, click ![down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-expand.png "down arrow") next to **[!UICONTROL Show]** and select **[!UICONTROL All]**.</li><li>When you generate an advanced report by portfolio, the resulting data is for campaigns that are currently mapped to the specified portfolios. The report doesn't include data for campaigns that were in the portfolios during the date range but aren't still there.</li></ul> |
| [!UICONTROL Columns] | \[Report Columns\] | The columns of data that are displayed in the report, and their order:<ul><li>To add a column, click the metric name in the left column, and then click ![Right arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-right-customize.png "Right arrow").</li><li>To remove a column, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Left arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-left-customize.png "Left arrow").</li><li>To move a column to the left within the report, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Up arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-up-customize.png "Up arrow").</li><li>To move a column to the right within the report, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-customize.png "Down arrow").</li></ul><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>To list only a specific type of data, click any of the icons above the list:<ul><li>![Properties](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/property-columns.png "Properties") for property names and IDs for ad network account or portfolio components, such as [!UICONTROL Campaign Status]<.li<li>![Traffic Metrics](/help/search-social-commerce/assets//traffic-metric-columns.png "Traffic Metrics") for standard traffic metrics, such as impressions and clicks</li><li>![Revenue metrics](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/revenue-metric-columns.png "Revenue metrics") for conversion metrics tracked for the advertiser, including conversion and site engagement metrics synced from Adobe Analytics</li><li>![Derived metrics](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/derived-metric-columns.png "Derived metrics") for custom derived metrics created by the advertiser</li><li>![Label Classifications](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/label-classification-columns.png "Label Classifications") for label classifications in Campaign, Ad Group, Ad Variation, Keyword, and Product Group Reports only</li></ul></li></li><li>By default, all monetary data in reports is shown in the format for US dollars (such as 1,000.00). To display the value in the correct currency format (but without any currency symbols in CSV and TSV formats), add the "[!UICONTROL Currency]" column to the report. If the report includes data for accounts with different currencies, then any "[!UICONTROL Total]" monetary values are simply the sum of all numbers in the column, regardless of currency.</li><li>Reports that include many conversion metrics, or custom derived metrics that include many conversion metrics, may take longer to generate.</li><li>To add, create, or edit new metrics, see "[Create a Custom Metric](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/custom-metrics/custom-metric-create.md)," "[Edit a Custom Metric](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/custom-metrics/custom-metric-edit.md)," and "[Delete a Custom Metric](/help/search-social-commerce/common-tasks/custom-metrics/custom-metric-delete.md)."</li><li>For descriptions of all available columns, see "[Basic and Advanced Report Columns](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/management/basic-advanced/basic-advanced-report-columns.md)."</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Order Results/Limit Rows by] | Sorts the report by up to two columns included in the report. The default values are different for each report type. To customize the sort order, select a report column, and then select <i>[!UICONTROL Ascending]</i> (to show results from A to Z or from 1 to 100) or <i>[!UICONTROL Descending]</i> (to show results from Z to A or from 100 to 1). Specify at least one column by which to sort. If you sort by two columns, then the report is sorted first by the first column specified and then by the second column specified. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Include assets with no performance data, except for assets with zero lifetime data] | ([!UICONTROL RSA Asset Report only]) Includes rows for which no performance data is available for the specified dates, inserting values of zero (0) for the missing data. By default, this option isn't selected and rows are shown only when data (whatever the value) is available.<br><br>When this option is selected, reports include performance data for ad network accounts without campaigns and for campaigns without active keywords, and for components that were disabled, paused, and deleted during the entire data range. In addition, the RSA Asset Report shows rows for all assets, except for assets with zero lifetime data.<br><br><b>Warning:</b> If you select this option and create a report for a large date range for many subcomponents that don't have data, then the report may take a long time to generate. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Share with others] | Allows other users with access to the same advertiser's data to view the generated report(s) and &mdash; if you save the report as a template &mdash; to use the template but not edit or delete it. By default, this option isn't selected. <b>Note:</b> Regardless of this setting, your reports and templates are always visible to all users in higher (administrator) roles and to any assigned Adobe Account Team members. |
| [!UICONTROL Advanced Filters] | \[Advanced Filters\] | Returns rows only when the value for a metric meets specified criteria; the metric doesn't need to be included as a column in the report. The list of available metrics varies by report type but may include custom derived metrics for the advertiser, the IDs and property names for each ad network and portfolio component (such as [!UICONTROL Campaign ID] and [!UICONTROL Campaign Status]), conversion metrics for the advertiser, and click-related metrics from the ad networks. Available operators include <i>[!UICONTROL contains]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL starts with]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL equals]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is greater than]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is greater than or equal to]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is less than]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is less than or equal to]</i>, or <i>[!UICONTROL isn't equal to]</i>.<br><br>To apply one or more filters, do the following:<ul><li>Select a metric and an operator, and then enter the applicable value. For example, to return only keywords with more than 100 clicks, select [!UICONTROL Clicks], select [!UICONTROL >], and then enter 100 in the input field.</li><li>(To apply additional filters) For each additional filter, click **[!UICONTROL +Add Filter]**, select **[!UICONTROL AND]** or **[!UICONTROL OR]**, select a metric and an operator, and then enter the applicable value.</li></ul> |
| [!UICONTROL Attribution] | [!UICONTROL Rule] | ((Advertisers with the Adobe Advertising pixel-based conversion tracking service only; [!UICONTROL AdWords Shopping Performance Report], [!UICONTROL Campaign Daily Impression Share Report], and [!UICONTROL Keyword Daily Impression Share Report] only) ) Within the report, how to attribute conversion data mdash; potentially across multiple ad channels and portfolios mdash; in a series of events that lead to a conversion:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL First Event]:</i> Attributes the conversion to the first paid click in the series within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) or, if no paid clicks occurred, to the last impression within the advertiser's [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j).</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Weight First Event More]:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the first event and successively less weight to the following events. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Even Distribution]:</i></li> Attributes the conversion equally to each event in the series to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Weight Last Event More]:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the last event and successively less weight to the preceding events. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Last Event]</i> (the default): Attributes the conversion to the last paid click in the series within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) or, if no paid clicks occurred, to the last impression within the advertiser's [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j).</li><li><i>U-shaped:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the first event and last events, with successively less weight to the events in the middle of the conversion path. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li></ul><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>All attribution rules except for [!UICONTROL Last Event] are available only for advertisers with Adobe Advertising click tracking and with conversion tracking from either Adobe Advertising or Adobe Analytics (with an Adobe Analytics integration).</li><li>Attribution rules apply to impressions on display ads and to clicks on paid ads in any channel. They don't apply to impressions for paid search or social ads, which can't be tracked at the event level.</li><li>When you report conversion data using any attribution rule except one of the "[!UICONTROL Last Event]" rules, the events leading up the conversion may occur across multiple portfolios. When the events occur across multiple portfolios, the report includes data for the conversion only when the ads or keywords in those portfolios are included in the report.</li><li>([!UICONTROL Transaction Report]) When you report transactions using any attribution rule except for "[!UICONTROL Last Event]" or "[!UICONTROL First Event]," the report includes one row for each event in the transaction path.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Impression Override Weight] | (For all attribution rules except [!UICONTROL Last Event] or [!UICONTROL First Event]) When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, attributes the specified percentage of a conversion value to impressions that occurred within the advertiser's [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j). By default, this value is 10%; you can change the value to any whole number from 0-100. This value is used only within the report.<br><br>When a conversion is preceded only by impressions, then the advertiser's [view-through weight](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#u-v), rather than the impression override weight, is applied to the impressions. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Conversion Attribution] | (Applicable to display campaigns only; [!UICONTROL AdWords Shopping Performance Report] only) Which types of conversions to report when prior events occurred:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Clicks]:</i> To report only conversions that resulted from clicks. Each conversion name is appended with "[!UICONTROL (CT)]."</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL View-throughs Only]:</i> To report only conversions that resulted from view-throughs.

In the View-through valuation method box, select an option:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Raw]:</i> To report conversions without applying a weight.</li>li><i>[!UICONTROL Weighted]</i> (the default): To weight each conversion according to the view-through weight specified for the advertiser.</li></ul></li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Clicks + View-throughs]:</i> To report all conversions. By default, each conversion name is appended with "[!UICONTROL (CT+VT)]." This conversion attribution type includes two additional options:<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Discreet columns for click & view-through conversions] &mdash; Includes three separate columns for each conversion type you include: one each for 1) click-through conversions, appended with "[!UICONTROL (CT)]", 2) view-through conversions, appended with "[!UICONTROL (VT)]", 3) and all conversions, appended with "[!UICONTROL (CT+VT)]." When you choose this option, select which of the three columns to use for filtering and sorting from the '[!UICONTROL Filter & sort using]" list: <i>[!UICONTROL click]</i> (the default), <i>[!UICONTROL view-through]</i>, or <i>[!UICONTROL click + view-through]</i>.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Conversions for search campaigns appear in the columns for click-throughs but not the column for view-through conversions.</li><li>[!UICONTROL View-through valuation method]: What value to give to each conversion that results from a view-through:</li><ul><i>[!UICONTROL Weighted]</i> (the default): To weight each conversion according to the view-through weight specified for the advertiser.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Raw]:</i> To report conversions without applying a weight.</li></ul></li></ul> |
