# [!UICONTROL MSA Ad Extension Detail Report]

*[!DNL MicrosoftÂ® Advertising] accounts only*

This report shows the impressions, clicks, spend, and average cost per click for individual ad extension elements (such as each link in a sitelink extension). Use this report to see the effectiveness of your ad extension elements.

When you run a report with only metric columns and no dimensions, then the generated report contains two duplicate rows: one with aggregated data and the other with all metrics.<!-- all metrics? -->

You can view data for the last 180 days. Search, Social, & Commerce pulls the data from [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] in real time, and it may take several minutes to generate reports with larger data volume.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the report includes a large volume of data, the report may fail. If this happens, run the report for a smaller time interval.
