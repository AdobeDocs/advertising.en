# The [!UICONTROL MSA Network Impression Share Report]

*[!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts only*

This report shows campaign-level impression share metrics and basic traffic metrics (cost, clicks, impressions) by ad distribution (search or audience) and network (such as [!DNL Microsoft] sites and select traffic or audience) for specified [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts.

When you run a report with only metric columns and no dimensions, then the generated report contains two duplicate rows: one with aggregated data and the other with all metrics.

You can view data for the last 180 days. Search, Social, & Commerce pulls the data from [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] in real time, and it may take several minutes to generate reports with larger data volume.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the report includes a large volume of data, the report may fail. If this happens, run the report for a smaller time interval.
