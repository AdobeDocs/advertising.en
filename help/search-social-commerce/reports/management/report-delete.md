# Delete reports

You can manually delete a report that's completed or still in progress. Reports are automatically deleted 90 days after they're generated.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the report was created using a [template](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/automation/templates/template-about.md), then deleting the report doesn't delete the template used to create it and therefore doesn't affect any future report instances that are scheduled. To delete a report schedule, [delete the report template](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/automation/templates/template-delete.md).

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search, Social, & Commerce] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Reports]**, which opens to the **[!UICONTROL Latest Reports]** tab.

1. Select the check box next to each report you want to delete.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

1. In the confirmation message, click **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
