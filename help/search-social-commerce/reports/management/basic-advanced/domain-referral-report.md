# [!UICONTROL Domain Referral Report]

<!-- If we remove this report, also remove concept topic "Domain Optimization." -->

The [!UICONTROL Domain Referral Report] includes the estimated number of paid clicks [^1] by domain name for campaigns within specified portfolios (when applicable) or ad accounts. You optionally can include conversion metrics. By default, the data includes the estimated number of clicks for each ad group/campaign/portfolio combination for each domain that generated clicks, and the rows are in descending order by estimated clicks.

Estimated impressions and estimated cost are available only for display tracking-only campaigns.

You can view data for the previous two (2) months plus the current month.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data is available for search and display campaigns only.

>[!TIP]
>
>Use the results to refine the network settings for your campaigns. For example, if ads on an ad network's partner sites or on a specific web site never produce conversions, then you may want to exclude ads from running on them. Use caution, however, in excluding sites from your campaigns because content and market changes may rapidly change the value of a site's traffic.

[^1]: The click (or click-through) data for these reports are presented as estimates rather than actual data because Search, Social, & Commerce may use different algorithms than the various ad networks do to detect valid clicks, and because Search, Social, & Commerce doesn't count keywords for which no clicks were recorded in the previous week. The conversion tracking system may also include data for ad network accounts with which Search, Social, & Commerce doesn't sync.
