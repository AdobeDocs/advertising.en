# [!UICONTROL Product Group Report]

The [!UICONTROL Product Group Report] includes cost, click, and (optionally) conversion data by product group, aggregated across accounts, campaigns, or ad groups. You optionally can filter the data by label. By default, the data includes one row for each applicable product target for product listing ads that received impressions for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order first by the start date for the time unit and then by product target by default.

You can optionally include advertiser-specific label classifications.

You can view click data for the previous two months, and post-click data for all ad networks from Search, Social, & Commerce and Adobe Analytics integrations for the previous 18 months.
