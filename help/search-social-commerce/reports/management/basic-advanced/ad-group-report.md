# [!UICONTROL Ad Group Report]

The [!UICONTROL Ad Group Report] includes cost, click, and (optionally) conversion data for one or more ad groups. By default, the data includes one row for each applicable ad group for each time unit in the specified date range, and the rows are in ascending order first by ad group and then by campaign.

You can optionally include advertiser-specific label classifications.

You can view data for the previous 36 months.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ad group-level data isn't available for [!DNL Google Ads] performance max campaigns. If you have performance max campaigns, expect discrepancies between the total ad group-level data for a campaign and the total data for the campaign.
