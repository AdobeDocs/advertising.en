# [!UICONTROL Keyword Report]

The [!UICONTROL Keyword Report] includes cost, click, and (optionally) conversion data for keywords that received impressions within one or more ad groups. You optionally can filter the data to include only keywords that contain a specific text string. By default, the data includes one row for each applicable keyword and match type combination that received impressions for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order first by the start date for the time unit and then by cost by default.

You can optionally include advertiser-specific label classifications.

You can view data for the previous 36 months.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the report includes data from ad groups in content-enabled search campaigns, then the [!UICONTROL Keyword] column in the completed report includes the applicable ad group names, such as "(adgroup content) Your Ad Group Name."
