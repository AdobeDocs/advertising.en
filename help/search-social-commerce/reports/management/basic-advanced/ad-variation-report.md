# [!UICONTROL Ad Variation Report]

The [!UICONTROL Ad Variation Report] includes cost, click, and (optionally) conversion data for each applicable ad variation (creative) that received impressions in one or more ad groups. By default, the data includes one row for each applicable ad that received impressions for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order first by creative (ad) title and then by ad network by default.

You can optionally include advertiser-specific label classifications.

You can view data for the previous 36 months.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ad-level data isn't available for [!DNL Google Ads] dynamic search ad (DSA), performance max, smart shopping, and [!DNL YouTube] campaigns. If you have those campaign types, then expect discrepancies between the total ad-level data for a campaign and the total data for the campaign.
