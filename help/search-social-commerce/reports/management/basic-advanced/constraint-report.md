# [!UICONTROL Constraint Report]

The [!UICONTROL Constraint Report] includes cost, click, and (optionally) conversion data for constraints that use the label classification architecture, aggregated across portfolios, ad networks, accounts, campaigns, or ad groups. By default, the data includes one row for each applicable constraint for each time unit in the specified date range. The rows are in ascending order first by constraint and then by the start date for the time unit by default.

You can view data for up to the previous 36 months.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any changes you make to constraints for an entity are visible in about one hour.
