# About model accuracy reports

Model accuracy reports indicate the accuracy of the cost and revenue models that are used to optimize bids, campaign budgets, and bid strategy targets for a portfolio, as appropriate for the optimization type and campaign bid strategy.

Inaccuracies can indicate performance issues, and you may need to adjust portfolio settings as a result. For more information about troubleshooting forecast inaccuracies, see "FAQs About Portfolios" in the Portfolios section of the Optimization Guide, which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce.<!-- verify convention for referencing Optimization Guide here -->
