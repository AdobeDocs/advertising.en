See [file name requirements for reports sent to an FTP directory](/help/search-social-commerce/reports/automation/ftp-reports.md). |
|  | [!UICONTROL Save as template] | (Optional unless you want to run the report according to a schedule) Saves the report settings as a template, which is available in the [!UICONTROL Reports] > [!UICONTROL Report Templates] view and can be reused to create new reports. To save the report as a template, select the check box.<br><br>To run the report according to a schedule, you must save the settings as a template.<br><br><b>Note:</b> You can save the current set of parameters as a new template even if it's based on an existing template. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Type] | The report type to generate. |
| [!UICONTROL Basic  Settings] | [!UICONTROL Template] | (Optional) A report template to apply, which pre-populates the report options according to the template. All templates saved for the report type and available to you are listed.<br><br>If you select a template, you can still change the report options, and you can even save the report as a new template. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Data Aggregation] | ([!UICONTROL Forecast Accuracy Report only]) The time unit that should be represented on each row of the report. The only option is <i>[!UICONTROL Daily]</i>. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Date Range] | The date range for which to generate data:<ul><li><i>[Preset range]:</i> A list of common time increments, ranging from <i>[!UICONTROL Today]</i> to <i>[!UICONTROL Last 180 Days]</i>. The default is <i>[!UICONTROL Last 7 Days]</i>, which reports the last seven days for which data is available. <b>Note:</b> <i>[!UICONTROL Last Month]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Last 3 Months]</i>, and <i>[!UICONTROL Last 6 Months]</i> show data for the previous calendar months.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Custom Date Range]:</i> Specify the beginning date and end date. Enter dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY or M/D/YYYY, or click ![Calendar](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/calendar.png "Calendar") next to a field and select a date.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Conversions Based on] | How to report conversion data:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Transaction date]</i> (the default): To see transactions whose transaction date occurred during the specified time period. This option shows you how much revenue was earned within the specified time period.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Click date]:</i> To see transactions that resulted from a click that occurred during the specified time period. When a portfolio has significant delay between clicks and transactions, this option is useful for computing the historical revenue per click for the portfolio, which indicates the revenue behaviors to expect over time.</li></ul> |
|  | \[Primary Filters\] | The portfolios to include. By default, data for all portfolios is included in the report if you don't make a selection. You optionally can narrow down the data to be reported by specifying individual portfolios.<br><br>To select a portfolio, select the check box next to the portfolio name, and then click &gt;&gt; to move it to the [!UICONTROL Selected Filters] column.<br><br><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>By default, only active and optimized portfolios are listed.

| [!UICONTROL Columns] | \[Report Columns\] | The columns of data that are displayed in the report, and their order:<ul><li>To add a column, click the metric name in the left column, and then click ![Right arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-right-customize.png "Right arrow").</li><li>To remove a column, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Left arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-left-customize.png "Left arrow").</li><li>To move a column to the left within the report, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Up arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-up-customize.png "Up arrow").</li><li>To move a column to the right within the report, click the metric name in the right column, and then click ![Down arrow](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/arrow-down-customize.png "Down arrow").</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Order Results/Limit Rows by] | ([!UICONTROL Forecast Accuracy Report] only) Sorts the report by up to two columns included in the report. The default values are different for each report type.To customize the sort order, select a report column, and then select <i>[!UICONTROL Ascending]</i> (to show results from A to Z or from 1 to 100) or <i>[!UICONTROL Descending]</i> (to show results from Z to A or from 100 to 1). Specify at least one column by which to sort. If you sort by two columns, then the report is sorted first by the first column specified and then by the second column specified. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Share with others] | ([!UICONTROL Forecast Accuracy Report] only) Allows other users with access to the same advertiser's data to view the generated report and &mdash; if you save the report as a template &mdash; to use the template but not edit or delete it. By default, this option isn't selected. <b>Note:</b> Regardless of this setting, your reports and templates are always visible to all users in higher (administrator) roles and to any assigned Adobe Account Team members. |
| [!UICONTROL Advanced Filters] | \[Advanced Filters\] | ([!UICONTROL Forecast Accuracy Report] only) Returns rows only when the value for a metric meets specified criteria; the metric doesn't need to be included as a column in the report. The list of available metrics varies by report type but may include custom derived metrics for the advertiser, the IDs and property names for each ad network and portfolio component (such as [!UICONTROL Campaign ID] and [!UICONTROL Campaign Status]), revenue metrics (transaction properties) for the advertiser, and click-related metrics from the ad networks. Available operators include <i>[!UICONTROL contains]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL starts with]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL equals]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is greater than]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is greater than or equal to]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is less than]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL is less than or equal to]</i>, or <i>[!UICONTROL isn't equal to]</i>.<br><br>To apply one or more filters, do the following:<ul><li>Select a metric and an operator, and then enter the applicable value.

| [!UICONTROL Attribution] | [!UICONTROL Rule] | (Advertisers with the Adobe Advertising conversion tracking service only) Within the report, how to attribute conversion data &mdash; potentially across multiple ad channels and portfolios &mdash; in a series of events that lead to a conversion:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL First Event]:</i> Attributes the conversion to the first paid click in the series within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) or, if no paid clicks occurred, to the last impression within the advertiser's [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j).</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Weight First Event More]:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the first event and successively less weight to the following events. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Even Distribution]:</i></li> Attributes the conversion equally to each event in the series to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Weight Last Event More]:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the last event and successively less weight to the preceding events. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL Last Event]</i> (the default): Attributes the conversion to the last paid click in the series within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) or, if no paid clicks occurred, to the last impression within the advertiser's [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j).</li><li><i>U-shaped:</i> Attributes the conversion to all events in the series that occurred within the advertiser's [click lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#c-d) and [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j), but gives the most weight to the first event and last events, with successively less weight to the events in the middle of the conversion path. When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, the specified impression override weight is further applied to the impressions. When the conversion is preceded only by impressions, the impressions are weighted according to the advertiser's view-through weight rather than to the impression override weight.</li></ul><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>Attribution rules apply to impressions on display ads and to clicks on paid ads in any channel. They don't apply to impressions for paid search or social ads, which can't be tracked at the event level.</li><li>When you report conversion data using any attribution rule except one of the "[!UICONTROL Last Event]" rules, the events leading up the conversion may occur across multiple portfolios. When this is so, the report includes data for the conversion only when the ads or keywords in those portfolios are included in the report.</li></ul> |
|  | [!UICONTROL Impression Override Weight] | (For all attribution rules except [!UICONTROL Last Event] or [!UICONTROL First Event]) When the conversion is preceded by both paid clicks and impressions, attributes the specified percentage of a conversion value to impressions that occurred within the advertiser’s [impression lookback window](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#i-j). By default, this value is 10%; you can change the value to any whole number from 0-100. This value is used only within the report.<br><br>When a conversion is preceded only by impressions, then the advertiser's [view-through weight](/help/search-social-commerce/glossary.md#u-v), rather than the impression override weight, is applied to the impressions. |
| [!UICONTROL Scheduling and Delivery] | [!UICONTROL Report Schedule] | (Optional; available only when the "[!UICONTROL Save as template]" option is selected) When to run the report: <i>[!UICONTROL Now]</i> (to run the report once; the default), <i>[!UICONTROL Daily]</i>, <i>[!UICONTROL Weekly on] [Day of the Week]</i>, or <i>[!UICONTROL Every Month] [Day of the Month]</i>. For all time periods except for <i>[!UICONTROL Now]</i>, select the hour in the advertiser's time zone, beginning with 09:00 AM. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Email Recipients] | <b>Note:</b>  This setting is used only when email notifications for [!UICONTROL Reports] are [enabled within [!UICONTROL Notification Center]](/help/search-social-commerce/notifications/notification-edit.md).<br><br>Email addresses of registered Search, Social, & Commerce users to which to send notifications when the report is completed or is canceled because of errors. By default, the address for your user account is entered. To specify multiple addresses, separate them with commas, spaces, or new lines. When the report is scheduled to run repeatedly, a notification is sent each time a report is completed. |
|  | [!UICONTROL Email Notification] | <b>Note:</b>  This setting is used only when email notifications for [!UICONTROL Reports] are [enabled within [!UICONTROL Notification Center]](/help/search-social-commerce/notifications/notification-edit.md).<br><br>(When [!UICONTROL Email Recipients] are specified) What to include in email notifications to any specified addresses:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Notification Only]</i> (the default):  To send only a notification of the report completion or failure, without attachments. The notification includes temporary, download links for all report formats.</li><li><i>[!UICONTROL XLS Attachment]:</i> To include a copy of the completed report in XLS format if the file is less than approximately 10 MB.
