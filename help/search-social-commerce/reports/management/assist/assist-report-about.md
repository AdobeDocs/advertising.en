# About assist reports

*Advertisers with Search, Social, & Commerce click tracking and with conversion tracking from Adobe Advertising, Adobe Analytics (with an [!DNL Analytics] integration), or provided in feeds using a token (`ef_id`) only*

Assist reports provide insights into the conversion paths for all of an advertiser's keywords and ads. Assist reports use data captured through the Adobe Advertising conversion tracking service, Adobe Analytics conversion tracking, and feed files that include tokens (`ef_id`), and can be generated only for advertisers with those services.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* A conversion path may cross multiple portfolios.
>* Adobe Advertising always stores the following events for each web surfer before a conversion:  a) the first paid click; b) up to 10 clicks for each channel (search, social, or display), including the first click; and c) up to 10 display impressions.
