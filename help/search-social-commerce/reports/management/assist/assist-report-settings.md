Depending on whether you are filtering by portfolio or ad network, indicate the components to include:<ul><li><i>[!UICONTROL Portfolio]:</i> One or more portfolios or their subcomponents (campaigns or ad groups). To select a component and all of its subcomponents, select the check box next to the component name.
