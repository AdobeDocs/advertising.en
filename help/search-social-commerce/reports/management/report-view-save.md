# View or save a report

You can view a report in the web browser, or open or save the report data as a [!DNL Microsoft Excel] workbook, a tab-separated values (TSV) file, a comma-separated values (CSV) file, or (some report types) a [!DNL Microsoft Excel] tabbed workbook.

>Adobe Account Team members and administrator users can view reports created by client and agency roles.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search] > [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Reports]**, which opens to the **[!UICONTROL Latest Reports]** tab.

1. Do either of the following:

   * (To view a report in the web browser) Click the report name.
   
   * (To open or save the report data in a file) In the [!UICONTROL Export] column next to the report name, click the name of a format, and then open or save the file according to your browser's normal procedure:

     * **[!UICONTROL XLS]:**   For an [!DNL Excel] workbook with a single worksheet (XLSX format). The report includes one worksheet that's labeled at the top with the parameters, with one row for each component reported when data for the component is available. Rows with no data are omitted.
     
       Basic reports include a total for each numeric column.
       
     * **[!UICONTROL TSV]:** For a TSV file. The report includes the parameters and one row for each component reported.
     
     * **[!UICONTROL CSV]:**   For a CSV file. The report includes the parameters and one row for each component reported.
