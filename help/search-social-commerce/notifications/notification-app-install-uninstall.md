# Install and uninstall the [!UICONTROL Notification Center] web application

*Beta Feature*

You can receive and manage notifications outside of your browser by installing a [!UICONTROL Notification Center] web application. The application looks the same, and has the same functionality, as [!UICONTROL Notification Center] within Search, Social, & Commerce. The application is available for [!DNL Google Chrome] 40 and higher or [!DNL Microsoft® Edge] 17 and higher.

Once you install the [!UICONTROL Notification Center] application, it's automatically enabled in the browser's applications manager, and it loads as a separate window whose layout is dynamically arranged based on the window size. You can open and close the application from the browser's applications manager or pin it to the operating system's taskbar or dock. The application is automatically updated.
