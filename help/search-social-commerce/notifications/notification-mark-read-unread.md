# Mark a notification as read or unread

*Beta Feature*

Marking a notification as *read* or *unread* changes the number of unread notifications indicated in the [!UICONTROL Notifications] link at the top of each page (such as ![Notifications icon with unread notifications counter](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/notifications-unread.png "Notifications icon with unread notifications counter")).

Notifications marked as *read* are in a lighter-colored text but remain available until you delete them.
