# About notifications

*Beta Feature*

You can configure your notification settings to subscribe to, or unsubscribe from, different types of alerts. You can view your notifications in any of the following ways:

* From the [!UICONTROL Notifications] panel, which is available from the main menu at ![Notifications](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/notifications-panel.png "Notifications").

* From [!UICONTROL Insights & Reports] > [!UICONTROL Notification Center Beta].

* From a [!UICONTROL Notification Center] web application, which opens [!UICONTROL Notification Center] in a separate window outside of Search, Social, & Commerce.
  
  The application loads faster than the regular browser version and is automatically updated. You can install the application and manage it using the browser's app manager.

* From push notifications to your browser.
  
  When you enable push notifications, they appear according to the browser's notification conventions.

You can view your notifications, mark notifications as read or unread, and delete notifications.
