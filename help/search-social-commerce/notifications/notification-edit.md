# Edit your notification settings

*Beta Feature*

You can optionally subscribe to, or unsubscribe from, email and web notifications about account authentication errors, all of your custom alerts that are triggered, and completion of the [!UICONTROL Advertising Insights] that you generate.

1. Open the notification settings in either of the following ways:
   
   * In the upper right of any page, click ![Notifications](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/notifications-panel.png "Notifications") to open the [!UICONTROL Notifications] panel. In the upper right, click ![Settings](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/settings-nc.png "Settings").
   
   * In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Search]** > **[!UICONTROL Insights & Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Notification Center Beta]**. In the left menu, click ![Settings](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/settings-nc.png "Settings").

1. Change your settings for any [notification category](notification-about.md):
    
    * To subscribe to, or unsubscribe from, notifications, move the slider in the [!UICONTROL Subscribe] column:
      
      * To unsubscribe from all notification types, move the slider to the left (disabled).
      
      * To subscribe to one or more notification types, move the slider to the right (enabled).
    
    * (When [!UICONTROL Subscribe] is enabled) To subscribe to email notifications, select the check box in the **[!UICONTROL Email]** column.
    
    * (When [!UICONTROL Subscribe] is disabled) To subscribe to web notifications within Search, Social, & Commerce and push notifications if they're enabled for the browser, select the check box in the **[!UICONTROL Web]** column.
    
      Web notifications are delivered only when you [enable push notifications](notifications-push-enable-disable.md) to your browser.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
