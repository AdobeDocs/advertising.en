[^1]: For most ad networks and campaign types, when you enable the "[!UICONTROL EF Redirect]" and "[!UICONTROL Auto Upload]" tracking settings for an active campaign (either set at the campaign level or inherited from the account settings), Search, Social, & Commerce automatically creates and uploads tracking URLs for the ad group components to the ad network each time it synchronizes with it. Otherwise, you need to generate tracking URLs and add them to the account, campaign, or campaign component settings. See "[When and how to generate click-tracking URLs by ad network and object](/help/search-social-commerce/tracking/click-tracking-ways-to-generate.md)."

[^2]: See "Eligible portfolio types by campaign bid strategy" in the Optimization Guide, which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce.

[^3]: Requires an integration with Adobe Analytics. See "[Overview of Analytics for Adobe Advertising](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising/integrations/analytics/overview.html)."

[^4]: [!DNL Analytics] data is sent to Search, Social, & Commerce using the upgraded AMO ID tracking parameter (beginning with `s_kwcid`), regardless of the AMO ID format you normally use for the account. If you normally use the older version of the AMO ID, then we recommend upgrading to the new AMO ID format for the best experience. However, even if your click/cost data and revenue data are tracked using different AMO IDs, both sets of data are fully classified and aggregated under the same campaign and account.
