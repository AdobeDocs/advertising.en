# About Adobe Advertising Search, Social, & Commerce

[!DNL Adobe] is the market and technology leader in customer experience solutions. Adobe Advertising simplifies the delivery of advertising campaigns cross-channel for brand and performance campaign management across any screen, in any format. Adobe Advertising consists of three sub-solutions: Advertising Search, Social, & Commerce for search, shopping, social, audience network, and performance max channels; Advertising DSP (Demand Side Platform) for display channels; and Advertising Creative for creating end-user experiences for your display ads.

As part of Adobe Advertising, Advertising Search, Social, & Commerce combines best-of-breed portfolio-based ad management with intelligent campaign forecasting and targeted ad delivery for data-optimized advertising.

## AI-driven technology for ad optimization

Search, Social, & Commerce automates and optimizes bid and budget management for ad campaigns across ad networks within the boundaries of an advertiser's business objectives, metrics, budget, and other business constraints. It tracks the click, cost, and conversion history for each of an advertiser's keywords and ads, as well as information about the bid landscape on each marketing channel. Using a portfolio theory approach, the optimization capability compares all possible allocations of your budget across an entire portfolio of campaigns to determine the bids and campaign budgets that will yield the highest possible return on ad spend, and it executes the bids and budgets accordingly. The optimization capability constantly monitors an advertiser's keywords and ads, dynamically adjusting bids and budgets as the marketplace changes.

Multiple types of optimization are available, allowing Search, Social, & Commerce and the ad network varying degrees of control over bid optimization. Depending on the optimization type, you can optimize your portfolios using conversions tracked by Adobe Advertising, Adobe Analytics, [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Google Analytics], or other first-party enterprise feeds.

Depending on your role, you may be able to view portfolio performance simulations, which use predictive modeling to identify your optimal spend point, and detailed forecast accuracy reports. All users can use the Spend Recommendation Tool to identify the optimal budget distribution across portfolios.

For more information, see the Portfolios chapter in the Optimization Guide, which is available within Search, Social, & Commerce.

## The advertising management interface

Search, Social, & Commerce provides comprehensive campaign management, optimization, tracking, and reporting across your ad networks. In the ad management views, you can:

* Sync your ad accounts for supported ad networks; set up and manage many campaign types manually, using bulksheets, and automatically using inventory data feeds; and optionally group your campaigns and ad sets into different types of portfolios for optimization.

* Set up access to other ad campaigns for which you want to only track and report. This may include uploading campaign data and metrics.

* Monitor and analyze the performance of your portfolios and any other campaigns that you're tracking via performance data views and detailed, customizable reports. For portfolios, prescriptive insights also provide visual, actionable data that you can use to improve performance.

* For optimal visibility into the performance data that matters to you, you can configure the various performance data views based on your needs and preferences. You may also automate report production using report templates and spreadsheet feeds. You can include conversion metrics from Adobe Analytics, [!DNL Google Ads], [!DNL Google Analytics], and your other first-party enterprise feeds in data views and reports.

See "[Supported Inventory](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/supported-inventory.md)" for more information about support for different ad networks and ad types.

## Integration with Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and services

Native integrations with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager let you connect your data and audience segments for ad targeting, [!DNL Google Ads] audience creation, optimization, and reporting/analytics.

For more information about integrations with these and other Adobe products, see "[Integration with Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and services](/help/search-social-commerce/introduction/integrations.md)."

## Conversion tracking

Adobe Advertising optionally provides a proprietary, pixel-based conversion tracking service to track online conversions for ads that link to your websites. When you use the pixel tracking service, Adobe Advertising tracks the clicks on your ads and the resulting transactions/conversions on your websites, precisely mapping each sequence of clicks and impressions to conversions. You can use the tracked conversions for bid and budget optimization.

The service allows you to optimize to different data attribution rules for the events that lead to a conversion (such as attributing conversions to the last related event or weighting the last event more). It also provides access to advanced reports that can be used to improve conversion rates, visibility into click assists, and analysis of day-of-the-week and intraday trends.

For more information about tracking, see the chapter on "Tracking."
