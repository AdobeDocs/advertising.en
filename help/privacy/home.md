## What's New

The following features are new or recently changed. 

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Released 10 March 2025 | Privacy | (Advertising DSP only) With [!DNL Adobe's] partnership with the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), Advertising DSP end users can now opt out of all behavioral targeting that relies on hashed email addresses from "Adobe Marketing Cloud - Advertising Services" (a legacy name for Adobe Experience Cloud that includes DSP + Audience Manager cookies). Previously, DSP supported opt-outs for only cookies and mobile IDs.<br><br>When an end user opts out of behavioral targeting, DSP captures the end user's cookie, mobile ID, or hashed email address (which DSP may associate with a [!DNL Unified ID 2.0 (UID2.0)] ID or a [!DNL LiveRamp] [!DNL RampID]). DSP then excludes behavioral targeting for ad impressions to that end user as long as the end user retains their opt-out cookie, which lasts for five years.<br><br>Your end users can either: a\) opt out of ads on their browser from [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info) or opt out of ads on their browser, apps, or using a token identifier from [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control).<br><br>No work is required for advertisers. | See "[Adobe Privacy Policy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html)." |
