# What's new

The following features are new or recently changed.

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 6 December 2023 | Planner | (Beta feature) The new planner tool helps to forecast the household-level unique reach of connected TV (CTV) placements according to specified budget and targeting criteria. After you evaluate multiple plans, you can implement packages and placements that best align with the desired outcomes. | See "[About the DSP Planner Tool](/help/dsp/planner/planner-about.md)." |
| 23 August 2023 | [!UICONTROL Placements] |  The new placement forecast tool shows the forecasted number of impressions, spend, and optimum maximum bid for a particular targeting strategy. Forecasting is calculated based on the overall inventory that is available with the placement and the unique users that are available. | See "[View the Placement Forecast Report](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-forecast.md)." |
|  |  | You can now quickly associate multiple ads with placements by downloading an spreadsheet file for a campaign or for one or more placements, editing the file to include values in the new “[!UICONTROL Attached Ad ID]” column, and then uploading the edited file. Use the column to add ads to the placement but not remove them.<br><br>To download a list of ad names and associated [!UICONTROL Ad ID]s, go to the [!UICONTROL Ads] view, create a custom view that includes the [!UICONTROL ID] metric, and then export the data. | See "[Download Placement Settings in a Spreadsheet](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-download.md)," "[Placement Setting Columns in Downloaded/Uploaded Spreadsheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-columns.md)," and "[Upload Placement Settings in a Spreadsheet](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-upload.md)."<br><br>See also "[Export Data from a Campaign Management View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-export-data.md)." |

By hosting your ads directly with the publisher, instead of in DSP, you can take advantage of custom rich media ad formats. Custom ad formats are typically run via direct reservations, so the ability to select publisher-managed ads in DSP also allows you to shift your direct reservation budgets to the programmatic ecosystem. | See "[About Programmatic Guaranteed Deals](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-about.md)" and "[Set up a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-set-up.md)." |
