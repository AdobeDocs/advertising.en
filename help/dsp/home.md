| 29 October 2024 | [!UICONTROL Custom Reports] | (Beta feature) Three new reports provide deeper insights into your paths to conversion:<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Path to Conversion Beta]: Shows the sequence of interaction points in the same household that lead to each of the selected conversion metrics in the specified data range.</li><li> [!UICONTROL Path Length Beta]: Show the number of conversions by path length (interaction points), such as how many conversions occurred after users had only one ad interaction, two ad interactions, and so on.</li><li>[!UICONTROL Time to Conversion Beta] shows the number of conversions by the length of time in days from the last interaction (ad exposure or click) to conversion.</li></ul> | See “[About Custom Reports](/help/dsp/reports/report-about.md).” |
| | [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], [!UICONTROL Ads] | You can now review the settings for all packages, placements, and ads in a campaign within one spreadsheet. You can download a QA sheet with existing settings for selected campaign component types (which can include Packages, Placements, Placement Ad Schedules, Placement Bid Multipliers, Ads, and Pixels) for review. To add or edit any of the settings, download an empty bulksheet template, enter or paste campaign component data from the QA sheet into the bulksheet template, and then upload the populated bulksheet.<br><br>In addition, the command name for downloading settings for specific packages and placements is now "[!UICONTROL Download Bulksheet]." You can upload settings for specific packages and placements from the [!UICONTROL ...] > "[!UICONTROL Upload Bulksheet]" option in the upper right. | See "[Review and Edit Campaign Component Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaign-components-review-edit.md)."<br><br>See also "[Review and Edit Package Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-qa.md)" and "[Review and Edit Placement Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-qa.md)." |
| | [!UICONTROL Placements], Private Inventory, [!UICONTROL Non Bid Reasons] | You can now filter the list of Non Bid Reasons for a placement by a specific private deal targeted by the placement. This feature isn’t available for placements that target all private inventory.<br><br>Also, the [!UICONTROL Placements and Ads] view for private deals listed at [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals] now includes a “[!UICONTROL Non bid reasons]” option on each row. Click the option to open the placement diagnostic report to the Non Bids tab, filtered by the private deal. | See “[View the Placement Diagnostic Reports](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-diagnostics.md)” and “[List the Placements and Ads for a Private Deal](/help/dsp/inventory/private-deal-view-placements.md).” |
| 25 September 2024 | [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Placements], [!UICONTROL Optimization] | [!DNL Oracle] will sunset its advertising business by 30 September. DSP has disabled all services from [!DNL BlueKai], [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud] (formerly [!DNL Grapeshot]), and [!DNL MOAT] and removed them from advertiser settings, campaign settings, placement settings, and optimization goals. However, any placements with existing [!DNL BlueKai] segments may continue spending for those segments until September 30.<br><br>The following alternatives are available:<ul><li>Standard third-party and custom segments: [!DNL eXelate], [!DNL Eyeota], [!DNL LiveRamp], [!DNL Lotame], [!DNL Neustar], and other available third-party data partners</li><li>Predictive third-party segments: [!DNL Proximic by Comscore]</li><li>Campaign-level brand safety and viewability measurement with [!DNL Integral Ad Science]</li><li>Placement-level pre-bid viewability with [!DNL DoubleVerify] and [!DNL Integral Ad Science]</li><li>Placement-level topic targeting by [!DNL Proximic by Comscore]</li></ul>CPM pricing for third-party segments is available in the [!UICONTROL Audience Library], and CPM pricing for services is available at [!UICONTROL Settings] > [!UICONTROL Fees]. | See "[Available Third-party Data Providers](/help/dsp/audiences/third-party-data-providers.md)," "[Brand Safety and Media Quality](/help/dsp/introduction/features/brand-safety-media-quality.md)," "[Campaign Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md)," and "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)."|
| 4 September 2024 | [!UICONTROL Packages] and [!UICONTROL Placements] | The following enhancements are available for packages and placements with the “Always Max Bid & Maximize Reach" and "Lowest Cost per Reach" optimization goals:<ul><li>Unique reach data aggregated at the package level, not the individual placement level, is now used to drive maximum incremental reach using bid optimization and budget allocation.</li><li>You can include household reach data from all programmatic guaranteed (PG) placements in the campaign to optimize for incremental reach using the new package setting “Link PG Placements for Incremental Reach Optimization."</li></ul> | See "[Package Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md)."  |
| 22 August 2024 | [!UICONTROL Custom Reports]  | The following custom report features and enhancements were released:<ul><li>The [!UICONTROL Reports] > [!UICONTROL Custom Reports] view was redesigned:<ul><li>Columns now include “[!UICONTROL Status],” “[!UICONTROL Report Run]" (which shows dates on which the report was triggered beginning on 22 August 2024),” “[!UICONTROL Recurrence],” “[!UICONTROL Created By],” and “[!UICONTROL Download Report]” (with a “[!UICONTROL Download]” button so you can immediately download any report instance from the last four months).</li><li>You can filter the list by status, whether the report is recurring or one-time, the report type, the destination type, and the report creator. By default, all unarchived reports created by the user are listed, with the most recent on top.</li><li>The quick action buttons for each report (such as [!UICONTROL Copy] and [!UICONTROL Delete] are now available by clicking **[!UICONTROL …]** next to the report name.</li></ul><li>Report scheduling options are now available at the report level, not at the individual destination level. In report settings, the schedule settings are now available near the top in the “[!UICONTROL Report run schedule]” section. If you edit an older report that has different existing schedules for individual destinations, you'll be prompted to set the schedule and notified that the schedule will replace the existing schedule for all existing destinations.</li></ul> | See “[About Reports](/help/dsp/reports/report-about.md),” "[Download a Custom Report](/help/dsp/reports/report-download.md)," and “[Report Settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-settings.md).” |
| 22 August 2024 | [!UICONTROL Packages] | You can now download the settings for one or more packages in XLSX ([!DNL Microsoft Excel] spreadsheet) format for review. The spreadsheet includes a separate tab with flight information. You can then make changes to most fields in both tabs and upload them back to DSP all at once. | See “[Review and Edit Package Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-qa.md).” |
| 14 August 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] | DSP no longer refreshes segment counts for [!DNL Audiences by Oracle (BlueKai)] segments, which will be sunset in late September, and all counts will gradually decrease to zero (0). | &mdash; |
| 30 July 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] | Beginning 14 August, DSP will stop refreshing segment counts for [!DNL Audiences by Oracle (BlueKai)] segments, which will be sunset in late September, and all counts will gradually decrease to zero (0). | &mdash; |
| | [!UICONTROL Packages] | Package settings now include an option to "[!UICONTROL Automatically rollover remaining flight budget to next flight]" when the [!UICONTROL Activate Custom Flighting] option is enabled. When the option is enabled, any remaining budget from the previous flight is added automatically to the existing budget for the next flight. You can't manually edit the [!UICONTROL Rollover] column when the automatic rollover option is selected.<br><br>In the [!UICONTROL Packages] view and the [Package Name] > [!UICONTROL Flights] view, the "[!UICONTROL Interval Goal]" column, which shows the current flight goal, includes the rollover budget. | See "[Package Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md)."  |
| 12 July 2024 | [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements] | In the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], and [!UICONTROL Placements] views, some metrics were renamed based on feedback:<ul><li>In trend charts, "Required spend" was renamed "Spend benchmark," and "Target spend" was renamed "Spend target."</li><li>In data tables:<ul><li>"Yesterday's required spend" and "Today's required spend" were renamed "Yesterday's spend benchmark" and "Today's spend benchmark."</li><li>The tooltips "Yesterday's pacing % and "Today's pacing %" were changed to "Yesterday's gross spend as % of yesterday's spend benchmark" and "Today's gross spend as % of yesterday's spend benchmark."</li><li>"Yesterday's target spend" and "Today's target spend" were renamed "Yesterday's spend target" and "Today's spend target."</li></ul></li><ul> | See "[Create a Custom Column View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-views-manage.md#column-view-create)" and "[Edit a Custom Column View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-views-manage.md#column-view-edit)." |
|  |  | [!DNL Oracle] will sunset its advertising business by 30 September 2024. This will disable all services from [!DNL BlueKai], [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud] (formerly [!DNL Grapeshot]), and [!DNL MOAT]. The following alternatives are already available:<ul><li>Standard third-party and custom segments: [!DNL eXelate], [!DNL Eyeota], [!DNL LiveRamp], [!DNL Lotame], [!DNL Neustar], and other available third-party data partners</li><li>Predictive third-party segments: [!DNL Proximic by Comscore]</li><li>Campaign-level brand safety and viewability measurement with [!DNL Integral Ad Science]</li><li>Placement-level pre-bid viewability with [!DNL DoubleVerify] and [!DNL Integral Ad Science]</li><li>Placement-level topic targeting by [!DNL Proximic by Comscore]</li></ul>CPM pricing for third-party segments is available in the [!UICONTROL Audience Library], and CPM pricing for services is available at [!UICONTROL Settings] > [!UICONTROL Fees]. | See "[Available Third-party Data Providers](/help/dsp/audiences/third-party-data-providers.md)," "[Brand Safety and Media Quality](/help/dsp/introduction/features/brand-safety-media-quality.md)," "[Campaign Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md)," and "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)."|
| 11 July 2024 |  [!UICONTROL Custom Goals]  | New support is available for custom goals (objectives): <ul><li>The names of objectives created in Search, Social, & Commerce for use with Advertising DSP packages must now be prefixed with "ADSP_"  such as "ADSP_Registrations." The prefix isn’t case-sensitive. Objectives with this naming convention are available as custom goals within DSP.<br><br>Your existing DSP objectives were already renamed for you, and no further work is necessary.</li><li>Weight recommendations are now generated for DSP-attributed metrics in objectives. When the objective includes at least one goal metric and one assist metric, recommendations are generated for non-mobile weights (which are used for ads on all device types for DSP) for each assist metric in the objective. Weight recommendations are calculated the next morning after you save or edit the objective definition. The recommendations are updated one day after changes to the objective are detected, or otherwise every seven days. When weight recommendations are available, an indicator (![Weight recommendations are available](/help/dsp/assets/weight-recommendation-available.png "Weight recommendations are available")) appears next to the objective name in Search > Optimization > New Objectives Beta. In one click, you can apply all weight recommendations. All weight changes to objectives prefixed with "ADSP_" are applied algorithmically in DSP within two days.</li></ul> | See “[Custom Goals](/help/dsp/optimization/custom-goal.md).”<br><br>For more information about objectives and applying weight recommendations, see the Optimization Guide chapter on "(Beta) New Objectives," which is available from within Search, Social, & Commerce. |
| 24 June 2024 | Certified ad serving partners | Support is available for high-impact display ad units served from [!DNL GumGum]. | See "[Certified Ad Serving Partners](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/certified-ad-servers.md)." |
| 19 June 2024 | [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements] | In the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], and [!UICONTROL Placements] views:<ul><li>Trend charts can now include the following optional metrics:<ul><li>**Day pacing:** Shows how the "Yesterday's pacing" metric is trending over time.</li><li>**Flight pacing ahead/behind:** Shows how the cumulative pacing (relative to the time elapsed) is trending over time.</li></ul>![New pacing metrics](/help/dsp/assets/trend-chart-pacing-metrics.png "New pacing metrics")</li><li>Data tables can optionally include new pacing-related metric columns:<ul><li>**Yesterday's required spend:** The amount that should have been spent yesterday for uniform distribution of the remaining budget through the rest of the flight.</li><li>**Yesterday's pacing:** Yesterday's spend as a percentage of yesterday's required spend. This is an improved version of "Today's OTS," which is now deprecated. When today's pacing is consistently less than 100%, the package or placement is struggling with its budget delivery.</li><li>**Today's required spend:** The amount that should be spent today for uniform distribution of the remaining budget through the rest of the flight.</li><li>**Today's pacing:** Today's spend as a percentage of today's required spend; the value is updated every 30 minutes. This is an improved version of "Yesterday's OTS," which is now deprecated. When yesterday's pacing is consistently less than 100%, the package or placement is struggling with its budget delivery.</li></ul></li><li>In data tables, the "Yesterday's goal" and "Today's goal" columns are renamed "Yesterday's target spend" and "Today's target spend."</li></ul> | See "[Create a Custom Column View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-views-manage.md#column-view-create)" and "[Edit a Custom Column View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-views-manage.md#column-view-edit)." |
| 10 June 2024 | [!UICONTROL Audiences] | (Beta feature) You can now convert your first-party segments from the [!DNL Amperity] and [!DNL Optimizely] customer data platforms to segments comprised of [[!DNL LiveRamp] [!DNL RampIDs]] or [!DNL Unified ID 2.0 (UID2.0)] IDs. Within placement settings for Audience Targeting, the shared segments are available in the First Party Segments list. | See "[Convert User IDs from [!DNL Amperity] to Universal IDs](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-amperity.md)," "[Convert User IDs from [!DNL Optimizely] to Universal IDs](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-optimizely.md)," and "[Support for Activating Universal IDs](/help/dsp/audiences/universal-ids.md)." |
|  |  | Documentation about DSP beta features for people-based, universal IDs for cookieless targeting is available. | See "[Support for Activating Universal IDs](/help/dsp/audiences/universal-ids.md)." |
| 5 June 2024 | Placements | You can now manage bid multipliers for multiple placements at a time using a spreadsheet. | See "[Manage Bid Multipliers for Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-manage-bid-multipliers.md)." |
|  | Audience Sources | You can now change the universal ID types to which the source audience is translated, and view a log of the changes. | See "[Manage Audience Sources to Activate Universal ID Audiences](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-manage.md)." |
| 22 May 2024 | Optimization, Connected TV Ads | In packages with the "Lowest CPA" and "Highest ROAS" optimization goals, the performance models for connected TV ads now use data from multiple touchpoints in the conversion path for quicker and more robust machine learning. Existing packages are upgraded to use multi-touch optimization, and no action is required. | &mdash; |
| 20 May 2024 | Connected TV Ads, Pixels, Retargeting Segments | (Open beta; available in US and AUS only) You can now retarget audience segments exposed to a connected TV campaign with additional ads to enhance cross-channel advertising:<ol><li>Set up an ad exposure segment and copy the impression tracking tag to the desired connected TV placement or ad to begin tracking for the segment.</li><li>In the retargeting placement, select the connected TV exposure segment in the [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting] section.</li></ol> | See "[Create and Implement a Custom Segment](/help/dsp/audiences/custom-segment-create.md)" and "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)." |
| 2 May 2024  | Ads, Pixels | You can download the ad settings and placement associations for all ads in a campaign in XLSX (Excel spreadsheet) format for review from the [!UICONTROL Ad Tools] view. | See "[Review Ad Details Using Spreadsheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-qa.md)." |
| |  | The [!UICONTROL Ad Tools] view > [!UICONTROL Attach Pixels] tab shows the third-party tracking pixels that are attached to your ads and provides a new workflow to attach pixels to one or more ads and to detach existing pixels. | See "[Attach Ads to Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-attach-to-placement.md)." |
|  | Placements, Audiences | You can now exclude individual audience segments or non-reusable audiences from placements via bulk edit tools or the placement editor. | See "[Edit Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-edit.md)" and "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)." |
| 18 April 2024 | Placements | You can now create and manage bid modifiers, by which a bid is multiplied to increase or decrease the bid, for specified target types for a placement. The default bid modifier is 1.00, which means no increase or decrease; values can range from 0.10 to 10.00. For example, a bid modifier of 0.50 decreases a USD 6 bid to USD 3 (0.50 x 6). When an auction qualifies for multiple bid modifiers, all applicable bid modifiers are multiplied. Bid modifiers never increase the bid to more than the maximum bid. | See "[Manage Bid Multipliers for Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-manage-bid-multipliers.md)." |
| 3 April 2024 | Inventory partners | The Adobe Advertising EU seat for [!DNL Google Authorized Buyers] was merged with the existing APAC seat. | See "[SSP Partners](/help/dsp/inventory/ssp-partners.md)." |
|   | Optimization | New `CPA` (cost per acquisition) and `ROAS` (return on ad spend) metrics in the package, placement, and related tables provide more accurate performance tracking for packages and placements with related goals. The new CPA metric considers only the final conversion event (such as signups) for computing the cost per acquisition, which gives a more accurate picture of the actual CPA than the legacy custom goal metric, which also included upper-funnel events (such as page visits and shopping cart additions) in its computation. Similarly, the new ROAS metric considers only the final revenue event (such as purchases and purchase values), which is more reliable than the legacy custom goal metric for tracking performance.<br><br>Now, when you set up a package with a CPA- or ROAS-based optimization goal, you must specify the final conversion or revenue event, as well as a custom goal that includes the conversion or revenue event; the custom goal can optionally include additional weighted upper-funnel events (such as page visits and shopping cart additions) to be used in addition to the CPA or ROAS metric for package optimization.<br><br>In addition, the performance-focused optimization goals were combined for simplicity:<ul><li>The new "[!UICONTROL Highest Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)]" goal replaces the legacy "[!UICONTROL Highest ROAS - Custom Goal]" and [!UICONTROL Highest ROAS (click focused) - Custom Goal]," with options to achieve either legacy scenario.</li><li>The new "[!UICONTROL Lowest Cost per Acquisition (CPA)]" goal replaces the legacy "[!UICONTROL Lowest CPA - Custom Goal]" and [!UICONTROL Lowest CPA (click focused) - Custom Goal]," with options to achieve either legacy scenario.</li></ul>Your existing packages that used the legacy goals were automatically migrated to the new goals with the relevant settings, and you don't need to update anything manually. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)," "[Package Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md)," and "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)." |
| 20 March 2024 | Placement Non Bid Reasons | All actionable non bid reasons (NBR), which are key data points that help troubleshoot underspend issues, are now available to self-serve customers. Previously, self-service users had only partial access to NBRs and had to rely on account managers or trading analysts (who have administrator access) to help troubleshoot. | See the [!UICONTROL Non Bids] section of the [placement diagnostics report](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-diagnostics.md). |
| 20 March 2024 | Planner | The new planner tool is no longer in beta mode. | See "[About the DSP Planner Tool](/help/dsp/planner/planner-about.md)." |
| 21 February 2024 | [!UICONTROL Alerts] for [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], [!UICONTROL Ads], and [!UICONTROL Deals] | A [!UICONTROL Pulse Panel] icon in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages] and package details, [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views indicates if any alerts are available for items within the view. You can open the panel to view each alert and optionally open the applicable view (for example, the [!UICONTROL Placements] view with the applicable placement listed) so that you can edit the settings as needed to resolve the issue. You can also optionally dismiss any alert.<br><br>In addition, the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views include an "[!UICONTROL Alerts]" column that indicates when an item or any of its components has an issue.<br><br>Alerts are available at the campaign, package, placement, ad, and deal levels. | See "[View Alerts and Notifications](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-alerts.md)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Placements] | New placement settings allow you specify a) a minimum placement budget to override the package-level budget allocation whenever sufficient budget is available and b) override the bid price algorithm to bid at least the fixed and floor prices for deals:<ul><li>In the settings for placements that belong to packages, you can now specify a minimum budget as a percentage of the package budget. To use the feature, select the placement funding option to "[!UICONTROL Set a Fixed Minimum or Maximum Budget]" (formerly "[!UICONTROL Set a fixed budget cap]"). You can still enter a [!UICONTROL Maximum Budget] in USD (like you could before for the budget cap), and you can also enter a [!UICONTROL Minimum Budget] as a percentage of the package budget. For existing placements, your existing settings are retained using the new field names.</li><li>In the [!UICONTROL Inventory Targeting] settings, a new option for [!UICONTROL On Demand] inventory and private inventory allows you to "[!UICONTROL Ensure Fixed or Floor Price for the bid]."</li></ul> | See "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)." |
| 7 February 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] and [!UICONTROL Ads] | The [!UICONTROL Ads Tool] now has a package filter. | See "[Attach Ads to Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-attach-to-placement.md)." |
| 24 January 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] and [!UICONTROL Ads] | The workflow for attaching ads to placements was redesigned. | See "[Attach Ads to Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-attach-to-placement.md)." |
| 10 January 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] | You can now quickly customize ad scheduling for multiple placements using a spreadsheet:<ul><li>You can download an ad schedule template for placements. You can edit the flight dates and ad rotation in the downloaded file as needed.</li><li>You can then upload the edited ad schedule template.</li></ul> | See "[Edit the Ad Schedules for Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-edit-ad-schedule.md)." |
| 21 December 2023 | [!UICONTROL Audiences] | Documentation is now available for sharing first-party data from the [!DNL Tealium] customer data platform with DSP using [!DNL Amazon Web Services]. You can target your DSP placements to the segments using [!DNL RampIDs]. Within placement settings for [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting], the shared segments are available in the [!UICONTROL First Party Segments] list. | See "[About Activating Authenticated Segments from Audience Sources](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-about.md)" and "[Workflow for Using the DSP Integration with [!DNL Tealium]](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-tealium.md)." |
| 6 December 2023 | Planner | (Beta feature) The new planner tool helps to forecast the household-level unique reach of connected TV (CTV) placements according to specified budget and targeting criteria. After you evaluate multiple plans, you can implement packages and placements that best align with the desired outcomes. | See "[About the DSP Planner Tool](/help/dsp/planner/planner-about.md)." |
|  | Optimization | Two new click-based optimization goals are available to all users: **[!UICONTROL Highest ROAS (click focused) - Custom Goal]** and **[!UICONTROL Lowest CPA (click focused) - Custom Goal]**. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)" and "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)." |
| 27 September 2023 | Optimization | Two new reach-based optimization goals, **[!UICONTROL Always Max Bid and Maximize Reach]** and **[!UICONTROL Lowest Cost per Reach]**, help you reach as many unique households as possible using the same level of impressions or spend, respectively. Both goals are available at both the package level and the placement level. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)." |
| 23 August 2023 | [!UICONTROL Placements] |  The new placement forecast tool shows the forecasted number of impressions, spend, and optimum maximum bid for a particular targeting strategy. Forecasting is calculated based on the overall inventory that is available with the placement and the unique users that are available. | See "[View the Placement Forecast Report](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-forecast.md)." |
|  |  | You can now quickly associate multiple ads with placements by downloading a spreadsheet file for a campaign or for one or more placements, editing the file to include values in the new “[!UICONTROL Attached Ad ID]” column, and then uploading the edited file. Use the column to add ads to the placement but not remove them.<br><br>To download a list of ad names and associated [!UICONTROL Ad ID]s, go to the [!UICONTROL Ads] view, create a custom view that includes the [!UICONTROL ID] metric, and then export the data. | See "[Review and Edit Placement Settings in a Spreadsheet](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-qa.md)."<br><br>See also "[Export Data from a Campaign Management View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-export-data.md)." |

For existing reports, the expiration date is 24 September 2023.<br><br>Before a report expires, all specified email recipients receive an email alert seven days and one day before the expiration date. To keep the report longer, change the expiration date in the report settings. | See "[Edit a Custom Report](/help/dsp/reports/report-edit.md)" and "[Custom Report Settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-settings.md)." |
| 19 July 2023 | Inventory | You can now run publisher-managed ads for programmatic guaranteed deals with Google Authorized Buyers SSP. By hosting your ads directly with the publisher, instead of in DSP, you can take advantage of custom rich media ad formats. Custom ad formats are typically run via direct reservations, so the ability to select publisher-managed ads in DSP also allows you to shift your direct reservation budgets to the programmatic ecosystem. | See "[About Programmatic Guaranteed Deals](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-about.md)" and "[Set up a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-set-up.md)." |
| 19 July 2023 | Reporting | The new [!UICONTROL Household Conversions Report] shows view-through conversions at the household level based on IP address, rather than at a device/cookie level. | See "[About Reports](/help/dsp/reports/report-about.md)" and "[FAQs About Household Reports](/help/dsp/reports/faq-household-report.md)." |
