# What's new
 
The following features are new or recently changed.

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 3 April 2024  | Optimization | New `CPA` (cost per acquisition) and `ROAS` (return on ad spend) metrics in the package, placement, and related tables provide more accurate performance tracking for packages and placements with related goals. The new CPA metric considers only the final conversion event (such as signups) for computing the cost per acquisition, which gives a more accurate picture of the actual CPA than the legacy custom goal metric, which also included upper-funnel events (such as page visits and shopping cart additions) in its computation. Similarly, the new ROAS metric considers only the final revenue event (such as purchases and purchase values), which is more reliable than the legacy custom goal metric for tracking performance.<br><br>Now, when you set up a package with a CPA- or ROAS-based optimization goal, you must specify the final conversion or revenue event, as well as a custom goal that includes the conversion or revenue event; the custom goal can optionally include additional weighted upper-funnel events (such as page visits and shopping cart additions) to be used in addition to the CPA or ROAS metric for package optimization.<br><br>In addition, the performance-focused optimization goals were combined for simplicity:<ul><li>The new "[!UICONTROL Highest Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)]" goal replaces the legacy "[!UICONTROL Highest ROAS - Custom Goal]" and [!UICONTROL Highest ROAS (click focused) - Custom Goal]," with options to achieve either legacy scenario.</li><li>The new "[!UICONTROL Lowest Cost per Acquisition (CPA)]" goal replaces the legacy "[!UICONTROL Lowest CPA - Custom Goal]" and [!UICONTROL Lowest CPA (click focused) - Custom Goal]," with options to achieve either legacy scenario.</li></ul></br><br>Your existing packages that used the legacy goals were automatically migrated to the new goals with the relevant settings, and you don't need to update anything manually. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)," "[Package Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md)," and "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)." |
| 20 March 2024 | Placement Non Bid Reasons | All actionable non bid reasons (NBR), which are key data points that help troubleshoot underspend issues, are now available to self-serve customers. Previously, self-service users had only partial access to NBRs and had to rely on account managers or trading analysts (who have administrator access) to help troubleshoot. | See the [!UICONTROL Non Bids] section of the [placement diagnostics report](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-diagnostics.md). |
| 20 March 2024 | Planner | The new planner tool is no longer in beta mode. | See "[About the DSP Planner Tool](/help/dsp/planner/planner-about.md)." |
| 21 February 2024 | [!UICONTROL Alerts] for [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], [!UICONTROL Ads], and [!UICONTROL Deals] | A [!UICONTROL Pulse Panel] icon in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages] and package details, [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views indicates if any alerts are available for items within the view. You can open the panel to view each alert and optionally open the applicable view (for example, the [!UICONTROL Placements] view with the applicable placement listed) so that you can edit the settings as needed to resolve the issue. You can also optionally dismiss any alert.<br><br>In addition, the [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views include an "[!UICONTROL Alerts]" column that indicates when an item or any of its components has an issue.<br><br>Alerts are available at the campaign, package, placement, ad, and deal levels. | See "[View Alerts and Notifications](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-alerts.md)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Placements] | New placement settings allow you specify a) a minimum placement budget to override the package-level budget allocation whenever sufficient budget is available and b) override the bid price algorithm to bid at least the fixed and floor prices for deals:<ul><li>In the settings for placements that belong to packages, you can now specify a minimum budget as a percentage of the package budget. To use the feature, select the placement funding option to "[!UICONTROL Set a Fixed Minimum or Maximum Budget]" (formerly "[!UICONTROL Set a fixed budget cap]"). You can still enter a [!UICONTROL Maximum Budget] in USD (like you could before for the budget cap), and you can also enter a [!UICONTROL Minimum Budget] as a percentage of the package budget. For existing placements, your existing settings are retained using the new field names.</li><li>In the [!UICONTROL Inventory Targeting] settings, a new option for [!UICONTROL On Demand] inventory and private inventory allows you to "[!UICONTROL Ensure Fixed or Floor Price for the bid]."</li></ul> | See "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)." |
| 7 February 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] and [!UICONTROL Ads] | The [!UICONTROL Ads Tool] now has a package filter. | See "[Attach Ads to Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-attach-to-placement.md)." |
| 24 January 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] and [!UICONTROL Ads] | The workflow for attaching ads to placements was redesigned. | See "[Attach Ads to Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-attach-to-placement.md)." |
| 10 January 2024 | [!UICONTROL Placements] | You can now quickly customize ad scheduling for multiple placements using a spreadsheet:<ul><li>You can download an ad schedule template for placements. You can edit the flight dates and ad rotation in the downloaded file as needed.</li><li>You can then upload the edited ad schedule template.</li></ul> | See "[Edit the Ad Schedules for Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-edit-ad-schedule.md)." |
| 21 December 2023 | [!UICONTROL Audiences] | Documentation is now available for sharing first-party data from the [!DNL Tealium] customer data platform with DSP using [!DNL Amazon Web Services]. You can target your DSP placements to the segments using [!DNL RampIDs]. Within placement settings for [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting], the shared segments are available in the [!UICONTROL First Party Segments] list. | See "[About Activating Authenticated Segments from Audience Sources](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-about.md)" and "[Workflow for Using the DSP Integration with [!DNL Tealium]](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-tealium.md)." |
| 6 December 2023 | Planner | (Beta feature) The new planner tool helps to forecast the household-level unique reach of connected TV (CTV) placements according to specified budget and targeting criteria. After you evaluate multiple plans, you can implement packages and placements that best align with the desired outcomes. | See "[About the DSP Planner Tool](/help/dsp/planner/planner-about.md)." |
|  | Optimization | Two new click-based optimization goals are available to all users: **[!UICONTROL Highest ROAS (click focused) - Custom Goal]** and **[!UICONTROL Lowest CPA (click focused) - Custom Goal]**. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)" and "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)." |
| 27 September 2023 | Optimization | Two new reach-based optimization goals, **[!UICONTROL Always Max Bid and Maximize Reach]** and **[!UICONTROL Lowest Cost per Reach]**, help you reach as many unique households as possible using the same level of impressions or spend, respectively. Both goals are available at both the package level and the placement level. | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)." |
| 23 August 2023 | [!UICONTROL Placements] |  The new placement forecast tool shows the forecasted number of impressions, spend, and optimum maximum bid for a particular targeting strategy. Forecasting is calculated based on the overall inventory that is available with the placement and the unique users that are available. | See "[View the Placement Forecast Report](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/placement-forecast.md)." |
|  |  | You can now quickly associate multiple ads with placements by downloading a spreadsheet file for a campaign or for one or more placements, editing the file to include values in the new “[!UICONTROL Attached Ad ID]” column, and then uploading the edited file. Use the column to add ads to the placement but not remove them.<br><br>To download a list of ad names and associated [!UICONTROL Ad ID]s, go to the [!UICONTROL Ads] view, create a custom view that includes the [!UICONTROL ID] metric, and then export the data. | See "[Download Placement Settings in a Spreadsheet](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-download.md)," "[Placement Setting Columns in Downloaded/Uploaded Spreadsheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-columns.md)," and "[Upload Placement Settings in a Spreadsheet](/help/dsp/campaign-management/qa/qa-sheet-upload.md)."<br><br>See also "[Export Data from a Campaign Management View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-export-data.md)." |
|  |  [!UICONTROL Custom Reports] | Custom reports now have an [!UICONTROL End Date], which can be up to four months away.

To keep the report longer, change the expiration date in the report settings. | See "[Edit a Custom Report](/help/dsp/reports/report-edit.md)" and "[Custom Report Settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-settings.md)." |
| 19 July 2023 | Inventory | You can now run publisher-managed ads for programmatic guaranteed deals with Google Authorized Buyers SSP. By hosting your ads directly with the publisher, instead of in DSP, you can take advantage of custom rich media ad formats. Custom ad formats are typically run via direct reservations, so the ability to select publisher-managed ads in DSP also allows you to shift your direct reservation budgets to the programmatic ecosystem. | See "[About Programmatic Guaranteed Deals](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-about.md)" and "[Set up a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal](/help/dsp/inventory/programmatic-guaranteed-set-up.md)." |

| March 2023 | [!UICONTROL Reports] | A new [!UICONTROL Household Report] shows impressions, reach, and frequency across various dimensions at a household level based on IP address, rather than at a device/cookie level.

| 12 September 2022 | Package and Placement Pacing | Separate pacing controls are now available for flight pacing and intraday pacing. Previously, a single strategy controlled both. Settings for your existing packages and placements were mapped as follows:<ul><li>Legacy **[!UICONTROL Pacing fill strategy]**=*[!UICONTROL Even]* &mdash; Now configured as **[!UICONTROL Flight pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Even]* and **[!UICONTROL Intraday pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Even]*</li><li>Legacy **[!UICONTROL Pacing fill strategy]**=*[!UICONTROL Slightly Ahead]* &mdash; Now configured as **[!UICONTROL Flight pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Slightly Ahead]* and **[!UICONTROL Intraday pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Even]*</li><li>Legacy **[!UICONTROL Pacing fill strategy]**=*[!UICONTROL Frontload]* &mdash; Now configured as **[!UICONTROL Flight pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Frontload]* and **[!UICONTROL Intraday pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL ASAP]*</li><li>Legacy **[!UICONTROL Pacing fill strategy]**=*[!UICONTROL Aggressive Frontload]* &mdash; Now configured as **[!UICONTROL Flight pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL Aggressive Frontload]* and **[!UICONTROL Intraday pacing]**=*[!UICONTROL ASAP]*</li></ul> | See "[Package Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md)" and "[Placement Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md)." |

|  | [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include [!DNL Clearcast] clock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad.
