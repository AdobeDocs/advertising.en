# About Correcting Placement Settings Using Spreadsheets

You can download the settings for one or more placements, or for all placements in a campaign, in XLSX (Excel spreadsheet) format for review. Use this feature to quickly review such details as:

* Which audiences the campaign targets.
* When the placements start delivering, and when they will stop.
* Which ads are attached to the placements.

You can then make changes to select fields and post them back to DSP all at once. Editable fields include the placement names, statuses, bids, budgets, pacing strategies, and frequency caps.
