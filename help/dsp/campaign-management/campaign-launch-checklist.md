# Campaign Launch Checklist

## Account Funding

Make sure your account has enough credit to run the entire campaign. You can check and refill account funds in [!UICONTROL Settings] > [!UICONTROL Account] or by contacting your [!DNL Adobe] account team.

## Campaign Status
  
Confirm that the campaign dates and budget are accurately set.

## Placement Status

Make sure the placement status is "[!UICONTROL Active]" or "[!UICONTROL Scheduled]." Also, verify that the other placement parameters (such as the site list, budget, goal, flight dates, and frequency) are correct.

## Ad Status

Confirm that all ads are attached, approved, and active. Also, verify that all tracking pixels are attached and functioning.
