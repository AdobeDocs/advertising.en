# View Alerts and Notifications

The Campaigns, Packages, Placements, and Ads views include an "Alerts" column that indicates when an entity (or any child entity under it) has an issue. Alert indicators include "Critical" (indicator-critical.png) and "Warning" (indicator-warning.png).

Hold the cursor over an alert indicator to see the number of alerts detected for the entity or any of its child entities. Click the alert indicator to open a details panel on the right, which includes the alert title and a collapsible list of the affected entities with a recommended resolution for each issue. You can ignore the alert if its not helpful. ["Ignore" button to dismiss it, or does this just mean to do nothing (in which case there's no need to mention it)?]
