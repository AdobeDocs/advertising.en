# View Alerts and Notifications

The [!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views, and the package detail view, include an "[!UICONTROL Alerts]" column that indicates when an entity (or any child entity under it) has an issue. Alert indicators include "Critical" (indicator-critical.png) and "Warning" (indicator-warning.png).

In addition, the [!UICONTROL Alerts Panel] icon in the upper right of the toolbar indicates if any alerts are available for the current set of entities that are listed. When the icon has a blue dot (![Alerts Panel icon when alerts are available](/help/dsp/assets/alerts-panel.png "Alerts Panel icon when alerts are available")), alerts are available. When no dot is visible (![Alerts Panel icon when no alerts are available](/help/dsp/assets/alerts-panel-empty.png "Alerts Panel icon when no alerts are available")), no alerts are available.

Alert indicators disappear when the underlying issue is resolved.
