# View the Placement Diagnostic Reports

<!-- Does this really belong in the Campaign Management > Reports section or in the Placements section? -->

The following tools can help you diagnose issues with placement setup and pacing once a campaign is live:

* **[!UICONTROL Change Log]:** Shows changes to key placement settings, such as the name, status, and maximum bid. Each entry includes the date and username of the person who made the change.
* **[!UICONTROL Ad Approvals]:** Shows whether ads were approved or rejected by the inventory providers. You can optionally change the status of any ad (for example, pause a rejected ad) or open the ad settings.
* **[!UICONTROL Non Bids]:** Shows why DSP didn't bid on the placement.
