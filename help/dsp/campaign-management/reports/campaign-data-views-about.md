# About the Campaign Data Views

In all campaign management views ([!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads]), you can customize the data that appears within the data table. You can customize the data in the following ways:

* Specify the data columns and their order by selecting a view from the view selector, editing the columns in an existing view to apply the changes temporarily, or creating custom column views.

   Each campaign management level ([!UICONTROL Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads]) includes built-in [!UICONTROL Pacing] and [!UICONTROL Performance] views that include relevant metrics for that entity. By default, the [!UICONTROL Pacing] view is shown so you can identify under-performing campaigns and campaign components at a glance. You can optionally [change the column view](column-view-change.md) to see performance data (using the [!UICONTROL Performance] view) or any saved column set. You can optionally [edit the columns](column-view-edit.md) in the [!UICONTROL Pacing] or [!UICONTROL Performance] view to apply changes temporarily.

   You also can save [custom column sets](column-view-create.md) that include any columns you want, in any order.

   ![column view selector](/help/dsp/assets/column-view-selector.png)

   In the column view editor, all metrics are alphabetical by category: [!UICONTROL Settings], [!UICONTROL Spend], [!UICONTROL Pacing], [!UICONTROL Reporting] (standard metrics that DSP tracks), [!UICONTROL Viewability], and [!UICONTROL Conversions]. Metrics appended with "([!UICONTROL Lifetime])" return values from the start of the campaign, regardless of the date range selected on the page.

   ![column view editor](/help/dsp/assets/column-view-editor.png)

   DSP saves your most recent view as the default view so that, every time you return to the page, you will always view the metrics that are pertinent to you.

* Apply [filters](campaign-data-filter.md) to change the data that is displayed on the current tab. Available filters vary by entity type but may include entity name, status, and additional property columns.

* Change the date range used in all standard and custom views.

* [Sort the data by the values in any column](campaign-data-sort.md).

* Control whether to display 25 rows, 50 rows, or 100 rows in the bottom right of any page.
