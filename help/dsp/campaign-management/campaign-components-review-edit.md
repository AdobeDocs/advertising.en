# Review and Edit Campaign Component Settings Using Spreadsheets

You can download the settings for the packages, placements, and ads in a single campaign in XLSX ([!DNL Microsoft Excel] spreadsheet) format for review. By default, the downloaded file includes separate tabs for package settings, package flight information, placement settings, and placement ad schedules. You can optionally exclude the settings for some campaign component types.

To update multiple settings at once, you can download a blank template file that includes tabs for each type of campaign component, enter or paste new or updated settings into the template file, and then upload the populated template to make the changes. Editable fields include most settings that are normally editable.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also download and edit the settings for only specific packages and specific placements. See "[Review and Edit Package Settings Using Spreadsheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-qa.md)" and "[Review and Edit Placement Settings Using Spreadsheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-qa.md)."
