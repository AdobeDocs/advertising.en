# Review and Edit Campaign Component Settings Using Bulksheets

You can download the settings for the packages, placements, and ads in a single campaign in XLSX ([!DNL Microsoft Excel] spreadsheet) format to review and edit the settings. By default, the downloaded file, called a *bulksheet,* includes separate tabs for package settings, package flight information, placement settings, and placement ad schedules. You can optionally exclude the settings for some campaign component types.

To update multiple settings at once, upload a valid bulksheet file with the changes. To create the bulksheet, edit a downloaded bulksheet with the existing settings. Editable fields include most settings that are normally editable.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also download and edit the settings for only specific packages and specific placements. See "[Review and Edit Package Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-qa.md)" and "[Review and Edit Placement Settings Using Bulksheets](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-qa.md)."

## Download Settings for the Packages, Placements, and Ads in a Campaign {#download-bulksheet-campaign}

1. Do either of the following:
  
   * Next to the campaign, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Download Bulksheet]**.
   
   * Click the campaign name. In the upper right, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Download Bulksheet]**.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Bulksheet Download] dialog box, deselect any campaign components whose settings you want to exclude from the downloaded file, and then click **[!UICONTROL Download]**.

  By default, settings for all campaign components are selected.
  
  A notification message indicates when the file is available to download.
  
1. To download the file, do either of the following:
  
   * In the notification message, click **[!UICONTROL Download].**
   
   * In the right of the top menu bar, click ![Jobs](/help/dsp/assets/downloads.png). Click **[!UICONTROL Download]** next to the job.
   
     The file is saved to the browser's Downloads folder.<!-- See "[Placement Columns in Downloaded/Uploaded Spreadsheets](#qa-sheet-columns)" for a list of the included columns. -->

     To edit any of the settings, edit the file directly and then upload the changes. All editable columns are highlighted in blue. To use the correct format for a field, select and copy the value from the relevant package setting or placement setting. For some target settings, such as dayparting, custom goals, and conversion metrics, a copy option is available within the setting. 

## Upload a Bulksheet with Package, Placement, and Ad Settings for a Campaign{#upload-bulksheet-campaign-components}

Upload settings for packages, placements, and ads in a single campaign all at once in a populated bulksheet.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.

1. Do either of the following:
  
   * Next to the campaign, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Upload Bulksheet]**.
   
   * Click the campaign name. In the upper right, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Upload Bulksheet]**.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Upload Bulksheet] dialog:

    1. Either drag and drop a file into the box, or click inside the box to select a file from your device or network.

    1. Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**.

1. (Optional) To verify that the updates were processed, click ![Jobs](/help/dsp/assets/downloads.png) in the right of the top menu bar.

  When any setting update fails, you can download a bulksheet error file with color coding to show which settings (rows) were saved and which failed, with a reason for each failure. You can then address the issues within the same file and upload it again to process the corrected information.
