# About Placement Management in Advertising DSP

A placement includes targeting parameters for one or more ads of the same ad type. You can create a placement for a single campaign or package, and then assign ads to it. Each campaign or placement can include multiple placements, with a specified ad rotation. By default, ads are rotated evenly.

Once you assign an active placement to an active package or campaign, then all active, approved ads in the placement are eligible to run based on the placement targeting parameters.

You can create a placement manually or by duplicating an existing one. You can also create placement templates to reuse, either manually or from an existing placement. You can attach additional ads to any placement. You can also edit, pause, or archive individual placements or use the bulk edit tool to make changes.

## Available Placement Types

* Pre-Roll
* Mobile
* Display
* Native
* Audio
* Connected TV
* Universal Video 

## The [!UICONTROL Placements] Dashboard

The [!UICONTROL Placements] dashboard centralizes performance and economic reporting across all of your placements, providing quick snapshots of how your placements have performed during a specified date range.

The dashboard includes a high-level, customizable trend chart with three metrics.

The dashboard also shows pacing and delivery metrics by placement, by default. You can optionally view performance metrics for the placements, and create custom column sets. You can download the entire data table to your browser's default download folder as a report in XLSM (macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet) format.

For each placement, you can open a detailed view ([the [!UICONTROL Inspector]](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-reports-about.md)), which includes performance metrics, pacing and delivery metrics, and custom column sets by site, ad, and inventory; and also frequency metrics. You can also take quick actions on the included sites, ads, and inventory, like excluding a site, pausing an ad or editing a deal. To open the Inspector, hold the cursor over the placement row, click **[!UICONTROL More]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL Sites]**, **[!UICONTROL Ads]**, **[!UICONTROL Frequency]** or **[!UICONTROL Inventory]**. You can export the data on the [!UICONTROL Sites], [!UICONTROL Ads], [!UICONTROL Frequency], or [!UICONTROL Inventory]  tab to your browser's default download folder as a report in XLSM format.
