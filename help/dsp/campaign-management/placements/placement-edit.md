# Edit Placements

You can edit the settings for a single placement or for multiple placements at once. Some settings can't be changed once the placement is live.

<!-- Some placements don't have these options. Clarify which placement types aren't eligible -- is it PG placements, or all placements using private inventory? And anything else? -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also download the settings for one or more placements, or for all placements in a campaign, in XLSX (Excel spreadsheet) format; make changes to a limited subset of key fields; and upload them back to DSP all at once. See "[Review and Edit Placement Settings Using Spreadsheets](placement-qa.md)."
