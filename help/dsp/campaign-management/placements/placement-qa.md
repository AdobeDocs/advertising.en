# Review and Edit Placement Settings Using Bulksheets

You can download the settings for one or more placements, or for all placements in a campaign, in XLSX ([!DNL Microsoft Excel] spreadsheet) format for review. Use this feature to quickly review such details as:

* Which audiences the campaign targets.
* When the placements start delivering, and when they stop.
* Which ads are attached to the placements.

To update multiple settings at once, you can make changes to select fields, save the file, and upload the edited bulksheet file back to DSP. Editable fields include most editable settings.

>To quickly edit more fields for one or more placements, see "[Edit Placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-edit.md)."
