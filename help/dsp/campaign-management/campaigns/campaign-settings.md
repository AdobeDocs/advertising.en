# Campaign Settings

## [!UICONTROL Basic Campaign Details]

**[!UICONTROL Name]:** The campaign name.

**[!UICONTROL Advertiser]:** (Read-only for existing campaigns) The applicable advertiser (brand). Select an existing advertiser or create a new one.

**[!UICONTROL Advertiser URL]:** The advertiserâ€™s official page. This field speeds your ad approval process with inventory partners.

**[!UICONTROL Timezone]:** (Read-only for existing campaigns) The time zone for reporting and bidding.

**[!UICONTROL Customer PO]:** (Optional) A customer purchase order for the insertion order/purchase order.

**[Campaign Dates]:** The campaign start and end dates.

## [!UICONTROL Campaign Goals]

**[!UICONTROL Margin Management]:** Whether to manage margins for the campaign: *[!UICONTROL Yes]* or *[!UICONTROL No]* (the default).

When you choose *[!UICONTROL Yes],* specify the margin type and amount:

* **[!UICONTROL Margin Type]:** The type of margin. You can't change the margin type once you enable margin management and save the campaign.

   * *[!UICONTROL Fixed]:* (the default) Allows DSP to auto-calculate and cap spend based on a fixed margin percentage of the [!UICONTROL Gross Budget].

   * *[!UICONTROL Dynamic]:* Allows you to manage margins down to the placement level by specifying a separate [!UICONTROL Budget Reserve %] and [!UICONTROL Gross Budget] for each package and placement in the campaign. DSP optimizes based on the financial efficiency of each placement, without guaranteeing a specific margin. Use this for insertion orders that consist of multiple line items for which you've agreed to deliver a fixed amount of units or unit types at a fixed rate.

* **[!UICONTROL Fixed Margin %]:** (Campaigns with fixed margins only) The default markup for each insertion order <!-- impression? -->, as a percentage. This amount is deducted from the [!UICONTROL Gross Budget] to define the net campaign budget.

* **[!UICONTROL Budget Reserve %]:** (Campaigns with fixed margins only; optional) Reserves a specified percentage of the [!UICONTROL Gross Budget] as a safeguard. This amount is deducted from the [!UICONTROL Gross Budget] to define the net campaign budget.

**[!UICONTROL Gross Budget]:** (Campaigns with margin management only) The gross campaign budget, before the specified marginal adjustments are applied.

You can optionally add an additional daily, weekly, or monthly gross budget:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add an additional Gross Budget]**.

1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Gross Budget]** and select the budget interval: *[!UICONTROL Daily],* *[!UICONTROL Weekly],* or *[!UICONTROL Monthly]*.

 The total net budget, which is the spending cap for the campaign, is automatically calculated based on the margin settings and is indicated below this value.

**[!UICONTROL Budget]:** (Campaigns without margin management) The overall campaign budget.

**[!UICONTROL Estimated Tax Withholding]:** Withholds a percentage of total spend across ad fees, ad serving fees, and/or data fees at the account level for country or local taxes. Rates are estimates for budgeting and pacing purposes, so invoiced tax rates may vary.

To estimate taxes to withhold:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Update rates here]**.

1. Specify the **[!UICONTROL Estimated tax rate]**, as a percentage.

1. Select the check box next to each fee type for which to withhold taxes. The fee types include:

   * *[!UICONTROL Include estimated tax - ads fee]:* Applies to all Advertising DSP media spend, including taxes on campaign management fees.

   * *[!UICONTROL Include estimated tax - ad serving fee]:* Applies to all spend on Advertising DSP except for media and data. It excludes taxes for campaign management fees

   * *[!UICONTROL Include estimated tax - data fee]:* Applies to all data spend on Advertising DSP.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

**[!UICONTROL Cross Device Level]:** (Read-only for existing campaigns created since 22 June 2020; not available for campaigns created before 22 June 2020) The level at which DSP will target ads and apply frequency caps: *Same Device* to target a device or *People* to target a person across all of their known devices.

**[!UICONTROL Device Graph]:** (Read-only for existing campaigns; campaigns with people-based cross-device targeting only) The device graph to use for cross-device targeting and frequency management:

* *[!UICONTROL LiveRamp - U.S. only]:* Available to all advertisers for cross-device targeting at $0.35 CPM for impressions that are delivered by using the [!DNL LiveRamp] device graph (that is, for devices not found within the targeted audience segments). You can set up cross-device targeting at the placement level.

    This option is also available to all advertisers, without any fees, for frequency management and attribution measurement.

**[!UICONTROL Frequency Cap]:** (Optional) The number of times a unique device or person (depending on the specified [!UICONTROL Cross Device Level]) may be served ads from the campaign. Options include *[!UICONTROL Unlimited]* or a specific amount per day, week, or month.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can set frequency caps at the campaign, package, and placement levels. DSP respects the strictest frequency cap in the campaign hierarchy.

**[!UICONTROL Packages]:** The [packages](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-about.md) to include in the campaign. Select existing packages and/or create packages to include. If you create packages, see descriptions about the [package settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md) for more information.
