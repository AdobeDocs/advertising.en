# Review and Edit Package Settings Using Spreadsheets

You can download the settings for one or more packages in XLSX (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) format for review. The spreadsheet includes a separate tab with flight information. You can then make changes to select fields in both tabs and upload the data back to DSP all at once. Editable fields include most settings that are normally editable.
