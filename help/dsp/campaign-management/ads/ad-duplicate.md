# Duplicate an Ad

You can duplicate an ad within the same campaign.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.

1. Click the name of the campaign.

1. In the submenu, click **[!UICONTROL Ads]**.

1. Next to the ad name, click  **... > [!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.

1. Specify the new ad settings:

    1. (Optional) Change the default ad name. By default, the new ad is called "Copy of \<*original ad name*\>."

    1. (Optional) Change the ad settings for [audio ads](ad-settings-audio.md), [connected TV](ad-settings-connected-tv.md), [display ads](ad-settings-display.md), [mobile ads](ad-settings-mobile.md), [native ads](ad-settings-native.md), [pre-roll ads](ad-settings-pre-roll.md), or [universal video ads](ad-settings-universal-video.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save & Submit for Review]**.

   The [ad review](ad-about.md) for the new ad takes 24-48 hours and includes checks for sensitive categories, click URL functionality, and preview rendering. The [!UICONTROL Status] column indicates whether DSP has approved the ad. Broken ads may have a pending status for longer than 24-48 hours so you have time to fix errors before they're rejected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your ad will only be served if both DSP and the SSP have approved the creative. Each SSP has its own approval requirements and process.
