# Review Ad Settings Using Spreadsheets

You can download the settings for all ads in a campaign in XLSX (Excel spreadsheet) format for review.<!-- Clarify once I can get this to work: Do these include all ads in the campaign, only active ads in live or pending campaigns, or what? And does it include all possible settings, or just a subset?  -->
