# About Performance Insights

*Beta feature*

<!-- Edit title and metadata as necessary -->

High-level, performance insights with visualizations give you the information you need to efficiently optimize your campaigns and to discover new opportunities to scale performance.

For any insight, you can download a report, without the visualizations, in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) format.

## [!UICONTROL Home] Tab

The [!UICONTROL Home] tab provides key standard, performance, and viewability metrics across all of an advertiser's campaigns<!-- active only? -->. By default, cross-campaign data is shown. You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser or data for only specific campaigns<!-- active only? -->, packages<!-- active only? -->, custom goals, and placements<!-- active only? -->. The insights include:

* A trend chart for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL Impressions], and [!UICONTROL Net CPM]).

* A breakdown of the data for specific metrics by three customer-specified dimensions, such as by campaign, publisher, and media type. For each dimensional breakdown, you can choose a different metric.

## [!UICONTROL Household Reach] Tab

The [!UICONTROL Household Reach] tab provides household reach metrics across all of an advertiser's campaigns<!-- active only? -->. By default, cross-campaign data is shown. You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser or data for only specific campaigns<!-- active only? -->. The insights include:

  * A trend chart by day or by week for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL Unique Reach], and [!UICONTROL Net CPM]).

  * A pie chart of the incremental household reach by [!UICONTROL Media Type], [!UICONTROL Device Type], or [!UICONTROL Inventory Type]. Incremental household reach is defined as a household reached exclusively through a single media, device, or inventory type.

  * A bar chart showing the [!UICONTROL Unique Reach] by [!UICONTROL Media Type], [!UICONTROL Device Type], or [!UICONTROL Inventory Type]. **Note:** A household reached by multiple media, device, or inventory types is considered overlapping.
  
  * A list of the top-spending campaigns, placements, packages, publishers, sites/apps, media types, inventory types, or device types. Metrics include [!UICONTROL Unique Reach], [!UICONTROL Net Spend], and [!UICONTROL Cost per Reach].
