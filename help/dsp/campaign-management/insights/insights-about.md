# About Insights

*Beta feature*

High-level performance insights with visualizations give you the information you need to efficiently optimize your campaigns and discover new opportunities to scale performance. You can view data across campaigns for a specified advertiser or drill down to a lower level.

Use performance insights to:

* Track long-term trends for strategic planning and informed decision making.

* Identify opportunities to achieve better outcomes.

* Improve efficiency by reducing the time between getting raw data and attaining actionable insights.

You can export all visualizations for a tab to a PDF file or download the data for a specific insight without visualizations in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) format.

You can also [change the date range, configure the view, and save a custom view](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-views-manage.md){target="_blank"} like you can for campaign management views.

## Types of Insights

### [!UICONTROL Home] Tab

The [!UICONTROL Home] tab provides key standard, performance, and viewability metrics across all of an advertiser's campaigns. By default, cross-placement data for a specific advertiser and custom goal is shown. You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser, a different custom goal, or a specific placement. <!-- I don't see campaigns or packages anymore:  You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser or data for only specific campaigns, packages, custom goals, and placements. --> The insights include:

* **[!UICONTROL Trends]:** A trend chart for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL Impressions], and [!UICONTROL Net CPM]).

* **[!UICONTROL Delivery Breakdown]:** A breakdown of the data for specific metrics by three customer-specified dimensions, such as by campaign, publisher, and media type. For each dimensional breakdown, you can choose a different metric.

### [!UICONTROL Household Reach] Tab

The [!UICONTROL Household Reach] tab provides household reach metrics across all of an advertiser's campaigns. By default, cross-campaign data is shown. You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser, for a specific campaign, across packages or placements, or for a specific package or placement. The insights include:

* **[!UICONTROL Trends]:** A trend chart by day or by week for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL Unique Reach], and [!UICONTROL Net CPM]).

* **[!UICONTROL Incremental Household Reach]:** A donut chart showing the incremental household reach by [!UICONTROL Media Type], [!UICONTROL Device Type], or [!UICONTROL Inventory Type]. *Incremental household reach* is defined as a household reached exclusively through a single media, device, or inventory type.

* **[!UICONTROL Reach Breakdown]:** The incremental unique household reach vs. overlapping household reach by [!UICONTROL Media Type], [!UICONTROL Device Type], or [!UICONTROL Inventory Type].

  *Incremental household reach* is defined as a household reached exclusively through a single media, device, or inventory type. *Overlapping household reach* is defined as a household that's reached by multiple media, device, or inventory types.
  
* **[!UICONTROL Top Performers]:** The top-performing campaigns, placements, packages, publishers, sites/apps, media types, inventory types, or device types by [!UICONTROL Unique Reach], [!UICONTROL Net Spend], and [!UICONTROL Cost per Reach].

* **[!UICONTROL Performance Analysis]:** The [!UICONTROL Cost per Reach] and [!UICONTROL Net Spend] by package, publisher, or site/app. Use this insight to see which packages, publishers, or sites/apps show the potential for significant incremental reach.

  The size of each bubble indicates the incremental reach score, with larger bubbles indicating a higher incremental reach on average. To see the full entity name and key metrics for any bubble, hold the cursor over the bubble.

  The levels of impact include:

  * **High impact:** Consider increasing the budget.
  * **Moderate impact**
  * **Limited impact:** Needs attention

### [!UICONTROL Household Conversion] Tab

The [!UICONTROL Household Conversion] tab provides household conversion metrics across all of an advertiser's campaigns<!-- active only? -->. By default, cross-campaign data for a specific advertiser and a specific conversion metric is shown. You can optionally configure filters to show data for a different advertiser or conversion metric, for a specific campaign, across packages or placements, or for a specific package or placement. The insights include:

* **[!UICONTROL Trends]:** A trend chart by day or by week for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL Conversions], and [!UICONTROL Net CPM]).

* **[!UICONTROL Conversion Participation Overview]:** A bar chart showing which media types, inventory types, and device types result in most household conversions. 

  Impressions delivered within the lookback period (30 days) are considered valid for conversion participation.

* **[!UICONTROL Top Performers]:** A table of the campaigns, packages, placements, publishers, sites/apps, media types, and inventory types that drive performance for three customer-specified metrics (by default, [!UICONTROL Net Spend], [!UICONTROL CPA], and [!UICONTROL Conversions]). The top performer is listed first.

* **[!UICONTROL Performance Analysis]:** The [!UICONTROL CPA] and [!UICONTROL Net Spend] by package, publisher, or site/app. Use this insight to see which packages, publishers, or sites/apps show the potential for significant incremental reach.

  The size of each bubble indicates the incremental reach score, with larger bubbles indicating a higher incremental reach on average. To see the full entity name and key metrics for any bubble, hold the cursor over the bubble.

  The levels of impact include:

  * **High impact:** Consider increasing the budget.
