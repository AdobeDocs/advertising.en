# Edit Private Deal Settings

Changes to an accepted deal aren't synced from the SSP. If you've accepted a deal but the publisher has sent changes, you can edit some elements of the deal settings from [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals]. You can also rename a deal at any time.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals].**

1. In the deal row, click  **[!UICONTROL ...] > [!UICONTROL edit]**.

1. Edit the [deal settings](deal-id-settings.md).

    You can edit the [!UICONTROL Deal Name], [!UICONTROL Media Type] (when the deal includes multiple media types), [!UICONTROL CPM] value, [!UICONTROL Account email], [!UICONTROL Advertisers that can access this deal], [!UICONTROL Flight dates], and [!UICONTROL Impressions].
    
    You can't edit the [!UICONTROL Deal ID], [!UICONTROL Publisher], [!UICONTROL SSP], [!UICONTROL Deal Type], or [!UICONTROL Billing Method]. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
