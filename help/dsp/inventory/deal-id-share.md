# Edit the Accounts with Access to a Private Deal

You can share a deal ID with multiple accounts. The deal is shared with all advertisers within the specified accounts, so that all users in those accounts can edit the deal or use it as a target for their placements.

You can stop sharing a deal with accounts to remove editing and targeting capabilities, but the feed remains visible to those accounts in reporting views.
