# View the Status of Your [!DNL On Demand] Deal Requests and Subscriptions

After you request an individual deal or subscribe to all of a publisher's deals, see if the publisher has approved or rejected each deal for each advertiser in your account.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL On Demand]**.
1. Filter the available deals to include deals that you've requested or subscribed to (**[!UICONTROL Currently subscribed to]**)**.
1. Do either of the following:
   * To view the deals in the [!UICONTROL Deal] view, click **[!UICONTROL Deal view]**.
   * To view the deals in the [!UICONTROL Subscription] view:
      1. Click **[!UICONTROL Subscription view]**.
      1. Hold the cursor over the publisher logo, and then click **[!UICONTROL See Deals]**.
1. Locate the [!UICONTROL Status] column to see the approval status.

## Deal Status

Publisher approval or denial can be based on the account type and campaign category for the account, the advertiser category, and the publisher's list of blocked advertisers.

* ![fully approved](/help/dsp/assets/approved.png) for deal requests that were approved for all advertisers in the account

* ![partially approved](/help/dsp/assets/partly-approved.png) for deal requests that were approved for some, but not all, advertisers in the account

   To see why a request was denied for an advertiser, click ![partially approved](/help/dsp/assets/partly-approved.png).

* ![denied](/help/dsp/assets/denied.png) for deal requests that were denied for all advertisers in the account

   To see why a request was denied for each advertiser, click ![denied](/help/dsp/assets/denied.png). If the reason for the denial is something that can be resolved, then you can [re-request the deal](/help/dsp/inventory/on-demand-inventory-rerequest.md).

If you have any questions about the approval process, contact your [!DNL Adobe] account team.
