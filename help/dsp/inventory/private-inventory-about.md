# About Private Inventory

*Not available to users with the account types "Ad Network," "Publisher Audience Extension," and "Other"; advertisers with the category "Other"; and resellers*

Advertisers looking beyond RTB can use private inventory to facilitate exclusive media transactions. Private exchanges allow publishers to create exclusive pools of inventory, which approved advertisers can use to buy via real-time platforms. A private exchange offers the confidence of a direct buy combined with programmatic benefits like efficiency, streamlined workflow, and centralized campaign analytics.

## Deal IDs

If you have direct relationships with publishers, you can streamline your media buying process and workflow by using your own private deals, with their negotiated inventory and pricing, in your Advertising DSP placements. DSP integrates with all of your publishers when you set up an account. If you want access to additional publishers later, contact your Adobe Account Team to set up access. <!-- + sentence from Ramey? (no longer here) about how we certify the publishers -->

All of your private deals with a deal ID are financed and invoiced by [!DNL Adobe].

You can use deal IDs in either of the following ways:

* (Optional feature that requires activation) From the [!UICONTROL Deal ID Inbox], you can review and quickly accept your agreed-upon guaranteed and non-guaranteed private inventory deals from publishers on the following supply-side platforms (SSPs): [!DNL FreeWheel], [!DNL Google Authorized Buyers] (formerly known as [!DNL AdX]), and [!DNL Magnite DV+] (formerly [!DNL Rubicon]) from the [!UICONTROL Deal ID inbox].

    For more information, see "[About the [!UICONTROL Deal ID Inbox]](deal-id-inbox-about.md)."

* You can manually set up information about a private deal you've already negotiated. 

You can use each private deal as a placement target for multiple campaigns across specified advertisers. For guaranteed deals, you must create a default placement after creating the deal, but you can add the same deal to additional placements to ignore the default placement.

## The Deals View

In the [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals] view, you can create private deal settings. You can also edit some deal settings; list the placements and ads, and attach additional placements and ads, to a private deal; edit the advertisers and accounts who can access a private deal; view a performance report for a deal; view auction insights for a private deal, or archive or unarchive a deal.<!-- ; or edit the attribute tags for a deal -->

The "Deal Health" column indicates each private deal's health status: "Success," "Warning," "Critical," or "Unavailable." You can click the status to see more details, including why a deal isn't performing or spending as expected and steps to troubleshoot potential issues.

You can customize how the existing deal data is presented by applying filters, customizing the visible columns and optionally saving custom views, sorting the columns, and viewing the data as charts.

## The Deal Lists View

In the [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deal Lists] view, you can group your private deals into lists for easier placement targeting.
