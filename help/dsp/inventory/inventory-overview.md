# Overview of Inventory Features in Advertising DSP

DSP can support your inventory needs, whether you’re wanting to find scale with public inventory, find scale among premium publishers with [!DNL On Demand], or set up a 1:1 private marketplace (PMP) deal with a publisher to activate against specific audiences or sites. Your campaign goals help dictate which type of inventory best suits your campaign’s performance needs. Integrations with top supply side platforms (SSPs) allow seamless setup and activation of your PMPs.

Once you access or identify your inventory deals in DSP, you can use them as placement targets for your campaigns.

Available inventory types include:

* **[!DNL On Demand] Inventory:** Explore pre-negotiated, non-guaranteed deals that Adobe has curated with premium publisher partners.

* **Private Inventory [!DNL Deal IDs]:** Set up and manage private marketplace deals (PMPs) that you've negotiated directly 1:1 with the publisher. 

* **[!DNL Simple Ad Serving]:** Use streamlined technology for guaranteed, non-decisioned ad delivery and reporting when your publisher can't execute your deal via deal IDs.

## The Deals Views

* **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals]:**

  * View all of your existing deals.

  * Further customize how the existing deal data is presented by applying filters, customizing the visible columns and optionally saving custom views, sorting the columns, and viewing the data as charts.
  
  * Create and manage private deal settings and [!DNL Simple Ad Serving] deals.

* **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals]:** View and manage [!DNL On Demand] inventory.

* **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deal Lists]:** Group your private deals into lists for easier placement targeting.
