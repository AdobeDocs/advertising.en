# Manage Deal Lists

<!-- Will later add fct for On-Demand deals, too, so keep title generic -- >

<!-- Need to add info/links to this from placement settings, and private deal-related topics, especially "Specify Placements and Ads for a Private Deal" -->

You can create and manage lists of private deals for placement targeting. Target or exclude specific private deal lists within placement settings. 

In custom reports, you can now a) filter data by deal lists \(as well as by individual deals\) and b) include the [!UICONTROL Feed] dimensions "[!UICONTROL Deal list]" and "[!UICONTROL Deal]" in the [!UICONTROL Build Your Report] section.
