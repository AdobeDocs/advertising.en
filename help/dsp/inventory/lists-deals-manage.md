# Manage Deal Lists

<!-- Will later add fct for On-Demand deals, too, so keep title generic. Later add "DSP On Demand Inventory to feature metadata -->

You can create and manage lists of private deals for placement targeting. Target or exclude specific private deal lists within placement settings. 

In custom reports, you can a) filter data by deal lists and b) include the [!UICONTROL Feed] dimension "[!UICONTROL Deal list]" in the [!UICONTROL Build Your Report] section.

<!--
