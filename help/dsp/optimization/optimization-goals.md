# Optimization Goals and How to Use Them

| Optimization Goal | Description  | When to Use This Goal |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Clickthrough Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest click-through rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize CTR if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set [!UICONTROL Max Bid], but the predicted CTR threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Click-through Rate<br><br>Ad types: Pre-roll, Display<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and a CTR goal that must be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible CTR while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Completion Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest completion rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize Completion Rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set Max Bid, but the predicted Completion Rate threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Completion Rate<br><br>Ad types: Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and a Completion Rate goal that must be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible Completion Rate while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Engagement Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest engagement rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize engagement rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set Max Bid, but the predicted engagement rate threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Engagement Rate<br><br>Ad types: Mobile Interstitial only<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and an engagement goal that must be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible engagement rate while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (Adobe - GroupM)] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest viewability rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize viewability rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set Max Bid, but the predicted viewability rate threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Viewability Rate<br><br>Ad types: Interactive Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> This goal always uses the placement-level Max Bid.<br><br>If the campaign's Viewability Sensitivity setting is set to “Standard (50% of ad in view for 2 consecutive seconds),” then the Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. If the campaign is set to “Strict (100% of ad in view & audio on for 50% duration)” then the GroupM viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. Ideally, you should match the campaign setting with the optimization goal and pre-bid filter settings. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (Adobe - MRC)] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest viewability rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize viewability rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set Max Bid, but the predicted viewability rate threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Viewability Rate<br><br>Ad types: Interactive Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> This goal always uses the placement-level Max Bid.<br><br>If the campaign's Viewability Sensitivity setting is set to “Standard (50% of ad in view for 2 consecutive seconds),” then the Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. If the campaign is set to “Strict (100% of ad in view & audio on for 50% duration)” then the GroupM viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. Ideally, you should match the campaign setting with the optimization goal and pre-bid filter settings. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (IAS - MRC)] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest viewability rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize viewability rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted is always the set Max Bid, but the predicted viewability rate threshold becomes stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Viewability Rate<br><br>Ad types: Interactive Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> This goal always uses the placement-level Max Bid.<br><br>This setting works best when third-party data from IAS is informing the algorithm. Use this goal only when you've enabled the IAS integration for the campaign. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid and Maximize Reach] | This goal attempts to achieve maximum household reach with a given number of impressions, always using the placement-level [!UICONTROL Max Bid].

| [!UICONTROL Highest Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)] | (Available at the package level only) Budget allocation prioritizes placements with the highest ROAS for a specified final conversion event, taking into consideration any weighted upper-funnel events (such as website visits and shopping cart additions) in a specified custom goal. You can specify whether the optimization model should learn only from click-based conversions or from both click- and impression-based conversions.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize ROAS. If spend goals are being met, then DSP balances lowering the CPMs with raising the ROAS. | Campaign Type: Performance<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Revenue<br><br>Ad types: Display, Native, Video, CTV, and Universal Video<br><br><b>Note:</b> See "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)" for more information. |
| [!UICONTROL Lowest Cost Per Click] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation prioritizes placements with the lowest CPCs.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize CPC.

| [!UICONTROL Lowest Cost per Acquisition (CPA)] | (Available at the package level only) Budget allocation prioritizes placements with the lowest CPAs for a specified final conversion event, taking into consideration any weighted upper-funnel events (such as website visits and shopping cart additions) in a specified custom goal. You can specify whether the optimization model should learn only from click-based conversions or from both click- and impression-based conversions.<br><br>Auction appraisals prioritize CPA. If spend goals are being met, then DSP balances lowering the CPMs with lowering the CPAs. | Campaign Type: Performance<br><br>Benchmark: Lowest CPA<br><br>Ad types: Display, Native, Video, CTV, and Universal Video<br><br><b>Note:</b> See "[Best Practices for Setting up Performance Campaigns](/help/dsp/optimization/campaign-best-practices-performance.md)" for more information. |
