# Sign in to Adobe Advertising DSP

Adobe Advertising DSP is transitioning to the Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for login authentication. IMS provides Single Sign-On (SSO) access to all [!DNL Adobe] products that support IMS, including Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Target, and Analytics. With the change:

* You can use one [!DNL Adobe ID] to sign in across [!DNL Adobe] products from either the Experience Cloud sign-in page or the legacy DSP sign-in page. Your [!DNL Adobe ID] provides user profile management. In a future release, youâ€™ll be able to change the DSP account, IMS organization account, and [!DNL Adobe] product from the top menu.

* Enterprise authentication is supported.

* You can stay logged in for 24 hours instead of logging in every hour.

Your current DSP login will remain active until 26 June 2025 so that you can prepare for the change.

## Use a legacy DSP login for authentication

* Go to [advertising.adobe.com](advertising.adobe.com), and sign in using your legacy DSP credentials.

## Use an [!DNL Adobe ID] for authentication

1. Open either of the following sign-in screens:

   * Go to [advertising.adobe.com](advertising.adobe.com), and then click **[!UICONTROL Adobe Account Login]**.
   
   * Go to [https://experience.adobe.com]( https://experience.adobe.com).

1. Enter your credentials:

   * If you already use an [!DNL Adobe] account, then log in with your existing credentials.

   * If you don't have an [!DNL Adobe] account, then look for an email inviting you to create an [!DNL Adobe] account. You'll receive one invitation for each of your DSP accounts. Follow the link in the email to set up your credentials. If you have multiple DSP accounts, follow the instructions to link them.

1. Choose your organization:

   * If prompted, select either **Personal Account" or **Company or School Account**.

   * If you have access to multiple IMS organizations, select the correct one.
