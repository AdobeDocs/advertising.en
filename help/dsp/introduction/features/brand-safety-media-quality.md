# Brand Safety and Media Quality

<!-- Check on logo sizes in staging environment -- I made them all 100 pixels high except for DoubleVerify, which is 150 (harder to see at 100), but some instances look larger in VS Code. -->

Advertising DSP provides a suite of brand protection features to ensure that each of your campaigns reaches real users in a brand-safe environment.

Our Fraud Surveillance team works closely with industry leading partners, such as the [!DNL Interactive Advertising Bureau], [!DNL Trust and Accountability Group] [!DNL (TAG)], and [!DNL WhiteOps], to carefully curate the inventory on our platform. Through proactive management of our supply, DSP ensures that all advertisers across the platform are protected from non-human traffic (bots, crawlers, datacenter traffic, and fraud) and deliver only in brand-safe contexts.

In addition to providing central quality management, we believe in empowering advertisers to design the controls that align with their brand. DSP offers integrations with [!DNL Comscore], [!DNL DoubleVerify], [!DNL Integral Ad Science], and [!DNL Peer39], ensuring that each advertiser can choose their desired level of fraud protection, contextual filtering, and keyword targeting.

## Quality Initiatives

### Inventory Verification with [!DNL Ads.txt] Support

[[!DNL Ads.txt], which stands for [!DNL Authorized Digital Sellers]](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt) is an initiative launched by the [!DNL Interactive Advertising Bureau] ([!DNL IAB]) in June 2017 to facilitate the proper representation of inventory on the open market, thereby combatting illegitimate sources of traffic and domain spoofing. Participating publishers and distributors publicly declare the companies authorized to sell their digital inventory, and the nature of those relationships, by maintaining an `ads.txt` page at the top level of the domain (such as `example.com/ads.txt`).

DSP supports [!DNL ads.txt] by reading each publisher's `ads.txt` file and giving you the option to purchase only from verified [!DNL ads.txt] sellers. For example, by matching the sellers we see accessing `nytimes.com` to the New York Times' `ads.txt` file, we can identify which are legitimate and which are not, and we'll block the offenders if the placement is configured to purchase only from verified sellers. <!-- can we actually mention NY Times? -->

You can set default [!DNL ads.txt] controls for each advertiser<!-- [default ads.txt controls for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) to:

* buy inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers only

* buy inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers and resellers only

* prioritize buying inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers and resellers

* buy inventory from all sellers

### Platform Fraud Surveillance

DSP has built strong internal tools and systems to manage fraud across our platform, partnering with leading industry vendors such as [!DNL Whiteops] and [!DNL Integral Ad Science].

In addition, Adobe works closely with [!DNL IAB] and [!DNL TAG] to ensure robust, industry-standard fraud blocking to protect our advertisers, leveraging tools such as [!DNL ads.txt] (see the previous section), the [!DNL IAB] Bots and Spiders list, and the [!DNL TAG] Datacenter IP list.

Through our multi-dimensional approach to quality, our team monitors anomalies and invalid traffic patterns, ensuring less than 3% invalid traffic on protected inventory. Any inventory that is suspicious &mdash; including inventory on specific domains or from specific publishers or sellers &mdash; is immediately blocked across the platform.

### Inventory Mapping, Tiering, and Categorization

Inventory mapping is the detailed review and on-boarding process required for all new inventory before it's added to our platform. This process is designed to ensure the safety and quality of all inventory on DSP.

* **Mapping:** Our Inventory team reviews each domain carefully, evaluating aspects such as:

   * Brand safety

   * Ad type verification

   * Generic content, duplicate domains, and fake ad serving

* **Tiering:** We holistically examine brand presence in the overall ecosystem to classify inventory across different tiers. You can [target your placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) to these tiers for the desired level of reach:

   * **[!UICONTROL T1]** &mdash; Brand-name, internationally-recognizable sites

   * **[!UICONTROL T2]** &mdash; Great-looking sites that are current, up-to-date, without user-generated content, and usually lacking in global recognition

   * **[!UICONTROL T3]** &mdash; User-generated content and niche content

* **Site categorization:** To ensure easy content targeting and blocking, we tag each property with a DSP-defined site category based on the property's content. You can [target or exclude these site categories for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) based on the placement goals.

### Comprehensive Support for Site Blocking

DSP provides both a globally blocked sites list and the option to create custom blocked sites lists for advertisers and accounts.

#### DSP Globally Blocked Sites List {#global-blocked-sites}

DSP maintains a globally blocked sites list of sites deemed unsafe to run ads on. This list contains sites featuring objectionable content (such as hate or terror) and sites infected by bots, fake pre-roll, mismatched domains, and other fraudulent activity.

As part of our Brand Safety initiative to root out activities that defraud advertisers, all sites are screened using the measures in the chart blocked sites list. All sites that don't pass the brand safety checks are added to the globally blocked sites list. Because DSP manages this list dynamically, sites may move on or off the list at any time, based on the latest brand safety analysis.

When you include a site on the globally blocked sites list as a placement target, the site is flagged with a red exclamation point (!). This indicates that ads don't run on the flagged site.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can optionally bypass the global blocked sites list for standard display ads attached to a trusted private deal by enabling the "[!UICONTROL Allow unscreened sites]" option in the [placement settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). If necessary, the Adobe Account Team can also optionally disable site blocking for a public (auction-level) deal in the publisher settings for the deal.

#### Account-level and Advertiser-level Blocked Sites Lists

Users can also maintain account-level and advertiser-level blocked sites lists<!-- [account-level and advertiser-level blocked sites lists](/help/dsp/admin/blocked-sites-list-edit.md) -->, which are used automatically for all placements. Lower-level blocked sites list are applied in addition to the globally blocked sites list.

## Third-party Integrations

### Contextual Filtering

Contextual filtering allows you to target or block ad opportunities based on the context of the page on which the ad would serve. Adobe provides contextual filtering via integrations with leading vendors in the industry: [!DNL Comscore], [!DNL DoubleVerify], [!DNL Integral Ad Science], and [!DNL Peer39]. Examples of current filters include [!UICONTROL Adult Content], [!UICONTROL Natural Disasters], [!UICONTROL Legal Drinking Age], [!UICONTROL MANGA], [!UICONTROL Epidemics], and [!UICONTROL G-rated Sites].

You can set default contextual filter controls for each advertiser<!-- [default contextual filter controls for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply when you use this feature.

### Pre-Bid Fraud Blocking

Leverage our third-party integrations with [!DNL DoubleVerify], [!DNL Integral Ad Science], and [!DNL Peer39] to block non-human traffic from your campaigns. These integrations provide industry-leading pre-bid blocking capabilities to minimize both general and sophisticated invalid traffic (GIVT and SIVT) in your campaigns.

You can set default pre-bid fraud blocking controls for each advertiser<!-- [default pre-bid fraud blocking controls for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply when you use this feature.

### Pre-Bid Viewability {#pre-bid-viewability}

Pre-bid viewability filters powered by our industry-leading partners [!DNL DoubleVerify] and [!DNL Integral Ad Science] allow advertisers to ensure their campaigns meet their desired viewability performance goals across video and display inventory.

You can set default viewability filters for each advertiser<!-- [default pre-viewability filters for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply when you use this feature.

### Attention Targeting and Measurement

[!DNL Adobe's] partnership with [!DNL Adelaide] provides advertisers with support for the Adelaide metric "[!DNL Attention Units]," which measures media quality based on eye-tracking, exposure, and outcome data.

[Placement-level pre-bid attention targeting](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) allows advertisers to target specific attention levels to improve customer engagement.

In addition, advertisers can enable [tracking for the placement-level [!UICONTROL Attention Score] metric](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md#attention-measurement) (the weighted average number of [!DNL Attention Units] across impressions) for any campaign to understand which placement tactics produce the best business outcomes.

Additional fees apply for each separate feature.

### Topic Targeting

DSP topic targeting allows you to target or block keyword lists by leveraging our industry-leading contextual partner [!DNL Comscore]. Topic targeting helps you to ensure your ads are always served in an environment that aligns with your brand, whether that includes blocking harmful content or ensuring spend in a context that ensures a greater outcome.

Topic targeting requires you to create custom topic segments directly with the partner platform. Once the segments are created, you can [target or exclude a segment ID in the [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting] section for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply for this feature.

To create a [!DNL Comscore] account and create custom topic segments, you can request a login for [!DNL Activation Segment Manager] at [https://agents.comscore.com](https://agents.comscore.com). See the [[!DNL Comscore] help center](https://comscoreactivation.zendesk.com/hc/) for full instructions for setting up custom segments. Fees for custom segments are visible in [!DNL Segment Manager] as you create them.

### [!DNL DoubleVerify Authentic Brand Safety]

DSP has partnered with [!DNL DoubleVerify] to offer its [!DNL Authentic Brand Safety] targeting solution, which allows you to create a centralized set of brand safety requirements to target across all of your buying platforms for consistency.

Once you have built a [!DNL DoubleVerify] brand safety segment with the necessary targeting, you can use it within DSP to replicate your post-bid block rules with pre-bid across web environments.

You can specify a [!DNL DoubleVerify] segment ID for each advertiser<!-- [specify a DoubleVerify segment ID for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [enable or disable [!UICONTROL Authentic Brand Safety] for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). DSP bills your account for usage for the segment ID.

For more information about functionality, contact [!DNL DoubleVerify] directly, or contact your Adobe Account Team.
