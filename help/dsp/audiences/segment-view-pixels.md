# View Tracking Pixels for a Segment

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Audiences] > [!UICONTROL Segments]**.

1. Hold the cursor over the segment row and click **[!UICONTROL Get Pixel]**.

   The page view tracking tag, which tracks desktop and mobile visitors to a webpage, is labeled "[!UICONTROL Desktop or mobile websites]."

   (Custom segments only) The impression tracking tag, which tracks users exposed to an ad unit on desktop, mobile, or CTV devices, is labeled "[!UICONTROL Desktop or mobile ads]."

1. (As needed) Copy the relevant tag(s) and provide the tags to the advertiser or website contact for deployment.

    Once a tracking tag is implemented, you can use the segment in the audience targets or exclusions for any placement.
