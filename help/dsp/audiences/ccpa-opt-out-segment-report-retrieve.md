# Retrieve Consumer Opt-Out-of-Sale Reports

You can retrieve monthly reports of IDs that customers have submitted for opt-out-of-sale requests for the account. You can retrieve the reports that were created in the previous three months. Each link is valid for seven days but refreshes each time a customer attempts to retrieve one.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can optionally retrieve consumer opt-out-of-sale reports using the DSP [!DNL Trafficking API]. For instructions, see the documentation for the [!DNL Trafficking API]. If your organization doesn't use the [!DNL Trafficking API] but is interested in more information, contact your Adobe Account Team.
