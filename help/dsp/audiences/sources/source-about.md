# About Activating Authenticated Segments from Audience Sources

<!-- Doesn't specifically explain what you can do in our UI -->

DSP can ingest first-party segments comprised of authenticated signals built within a customer data platform (CDP). You can use the ingested segments as targets for your placements.

## [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Profile]

DSP is integrated with the [the [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Profile (CDP)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html), which is part of the Adobe Experience Platform.

In [!DNL Real-time CDP], *destinations* are connections to external data platforms that allow seamless data activation. For example, you can use destinations to activate your known customer relationships (such as hashed email addresses) for targeted advertising across digital formats supported by DSP.

For more information about destinations, see the Experience Platform [Destinations Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/home.html), including an overview of the product, instructions for [creating destination workspaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.html) and [creating destination connections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/connect-destination.html), and [activating data to destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.html). 

### Workflow for Using the DSP Integration with [!DNL Real-time CDP] {#workflow-sources}

1. [Allow DSP to translate customer data segments into [!DNL LiveRamp RampIDs]](source-durable-id.md) that are recognizable in a biddable environment.<!-- I don't think I need this here: This requires DSP account-level and campaign-level settings to enable segment sharing with [!DNL LiveRamp], which will translate customer data to [!DNL RampIDs] to create targetable segments. Your Adobe Account Team will perform this configuration. -->

1. [Create an audience source](source-create.md) to import audiences to your DSP account or an advertiser account.

1. [Configure a [!DNL Real-Time CDP] destination connection in Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud-connection.html).
