# Workflow for Using the DSP Integration with [!DNL Adobe Real-Time CDP]

1. [Allow DSP to translate customer data segments into universal IDs](source-universal-id.md) that are recognizable in a biddable environment.

1. [Create an audience source](source-create.md) to import audiences to your DSP account or an advertiser account.

1. In Experience Platform, configure an Advertising DSP destination connection using the [!UICONTROL Source Key] that was generated in the DSP source settings.

   For instructions for activating the DSP destination connection, selecting segments, and accessing control permissions, see "[Adobe Advertising Cloud DSP connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud-connection.html)."

For additional support, contact your Adobe Account Team or `adcloud-support@adobe.com`.
