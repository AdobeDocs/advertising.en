# Convert User IDs from [!DNL Adobe Real-Time CDP] to Universal IDs

Use the DSP integration with [the [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html), which is part of the Adobe Experience Platform, to convert your hashed email addresses to universal IDs for targeted advertising.

1. (To convert email addresses to [!DNL RampIDs] or [!DNL ID5] IDs; advertisers with [[!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/overview.md)) Set up tracking for [!DNL Analytics] measurement:

   1. (If you haven't already done so) Complete all [prerequisites for implementing [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/prerequisites.md) and the [AMO ID and EF ID in your tracking URLs](/help/integrations/analytics/ids.md).
   
   1. Deploy a second, universal ID-specific JavaScript tag for on your webpages to match conversions from the IDs to view-throughs:

      * For [!DNL RampIDs], Contact your Adobe Account Team, who will give you instructions to register for a [!DNL LiveRamp] [!DNL LaunchPad] tag. Registration is free, but you must sign an agreement. Once you register, your Adobe Account Team will generate and provide a unique tag for your organization to implement on your webpages.
      
      * For [!DNL ID5] IDs: Contact your Adobe Account Team, who will give you instructions to register for the tag with ID5. Registration is free, but you must sign an agreement. Once you register, a member of ID5â€™s technical team will provide a unique tag for your organization to implement on your webpages.

1. [Create an audience source](source-create.md) to import audiences to your DSP account or an advertiser account. You can choose to convert your user identifiers to any of the [available universal ID formats](source-about.md).

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, configure an Advertising DSP destination connection using the [!UICONTROL Source Key] that was generated in the DSP source settings.

   For instructions for activating the DSP destination connection, selecting segments, and accessing control permissions, see "[Adobe Advertising Cloud DSP connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud-connection.html)."

1. After you complete all steps, verify in your audience library (which is available when you create or edit an audience from [!UICONTROL Audiences] > [!UICONTROL All Audiences] or within placement settings) that the segment is populating within 24 hours. Compare the number of universal IDs with the number of original hashed email addresses.

   The translation rate of hashed email addresses to universal IDs should be greater than 90%. For example, if you send 100 hashed email addresses from your customer data platform, they should be translated to more than 90 universal IDs. A translation rate of 90% or less is an issue.
   
   For troubleshooting support, contact your Adobe Account Team or `adcloud-support@adobe.com`.

Segments are refreshed every 24 hours.
