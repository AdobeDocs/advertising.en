# Convert User IDs from [!DNL Adobe Real-Time CDP] to Universal IDs

Use the DSP integration with [the [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html), which is part of the Adobe Experience Platform, to convert your hashed email addresses to universal IDs for targeted advertising.

<!-- Probably selected by default for all users

1. Contact `adcloud-support@adobe.com` to enable the account-level “[!UICONTROL LiveRamp segments]” option, which allows you to target authenticated segments in DSP campaigns once all steps in the activation workflow are completed.

-->

1. (To convert email addresses to [!DNL RampIDs] or [!DNL ID5] IDs<!--verify that it's not needed for importing segments directly from LiveRamp -->; advertisers with [[!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/overview.md)) Obtain a Javascript tag to match conversions to view-throughs and implement it on your webpages.<!-- Maybe put instructions on a separate page and put an x-ref to that here and in other procedures? -->

   * For [!DNL RampIDs], Contact your Adobe Account Team, who will give you instructions to register for a [!DNL LiveRamp] [!DNL LaunchPad] tag. Registration is free, but you must sign an agreement. Once you register, your Adobe Account Team will generate and provide a unique tag for your organization to implement on your webpages.

   * For [!DNL ID5] IDs: Contact your Adobe Account Team, who will give you instructions to register for the tag with ID5. Registration is free, but you must sign an agreement. Once you register, a member of ID5’s technical team will provide a unique tag for your organization to implement on your webpages.

1. [Create an audience source](source-create.md) to import audiences to your DSP account or an advertiser account. You can choose to convert your user identifiers to any of the [available universal ID formats](source-about.md).

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, configure an Advertising DSP destination connection using the [!UICONTROL Source Key] that was generated in the DSP source settings.

   For instructions for activating the DSP destination connection, selecting segments, and accessing control permissions, see "[Adobe Advertising Cloud DSP connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud-connection.html)."

1. After you complete all steps, verify in your audience library (which is available when you create or edit an audience from [!UICONTROL Audiences] > [!UICONTROL All Audiences] or within placement settings) that the segment is populating within 24 hours. Compare the number of universal IDs with the number of original hashed email addresses.<!-- What about for ID5, which uses multiple signals? -->

   The translation rate of hashed email addresses<!-- What about for ID5, which uses multiple signals? --> to universal IDs should be greater than 90%. For example, if you send 100 hashed email addresses from your customer data platform, they should be translated to more than 90 universal IDs. A translation rate of 90% or less is an issue.
   
   For troubleshooting support, contact your Adobe Account Team or `adcloud-support@adobe.com`.

Segments are refreshed every 24 hours.<!-- verify -->
