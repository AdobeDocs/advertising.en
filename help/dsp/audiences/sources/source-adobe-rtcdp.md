# Convert User IDs from [!DNL Adobe Real-Time CDP] to Universal IDs

*Beta feature*

Use the DSP integration with [the [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html), which is part of the Adobe Experience Platform, to convert your hashed email addresses to universal IDs for targeted advertising.

1. (To convert email addresses to [!DNL RampIDs]<!-- or [!DNL ID5] IDs -->; advertisers with [[!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/overview.md)) Set up tracking for [!DNL Analytics] measurement:

   1. (If you haven't already done so) Complete all [prerequisites for implementing [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](/help/integrations/analytics/prerequisites.md) and the [AMO ID and EF ID in your tracking URLs](/help/integrations/analytics/ids.md).
   
   1. Register with the universal ID partner and deploy universal ID-specific code on your webpages to match conversions from the IDs on desktop and mobile web browsers (but not mobile apps) to view-throughs:
   
      * **For [!DNL RampIDs]:** You must deploy an additional JavaScript tag on your webpages to match conversions from the IDs on desktop and mobile web browsers (but not mobile apps) to view-throughs. Contact your Adobe Account Team, who will give you instructions to register for a [!DNL LiveRamp] [!DNL LaunchPad] tag from [!DNL LiveRamp] Authentication Traffic Solutions. Registration is free, but you must sign an agreement. Once you register, your Adobe Account Team will generate and provide a unique tag for your organization to implement on your webpages.

1. [Create an audience source](source-manage.md) to import audiences to your DSP account or an advertiser account. You can choose to convert your user identifiers to any of the [available universal ID formats](source-about.md).

   The source settings will include an auto-generated source key, which you'll use in the next step.

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, configure an Advertising DSP destination connection using the [!UICONTROL Source Key] that was generated in the DSP source settings.

   For instructions for activating the DSP destination connection, selecting segments, and accessing control permissions, see "[Adobe Advertising Cloud DSP connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud-connection.html)."

   The source email addresses must be hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.

1. After you complete all steps, verify in your audience library (which is available when you create or edit an audience from [!UICONTROL Audiences] > [!UICONTROL All Audiences] or within placement settings) that the segment is populating within 24 hours. Compare the number of universal IDs with the number of original hashed email addresses.

   The translation rate of hashed email addresses to universal IDs should be greater than 90%. For example, if you send 100 hashed email addresses from your customer data platform, they should be translated to more than 90 universal IDs. A translation rate of 90% or less is an issue. For more information about how the segment counts can vary, see "[Causes for Data Variances Between Email IDs and Universal IDs](#universal-ids-data-variances)."
   
   For troubleshooting support, contact your Adobe Account Team or `adcloud-support@adobe.com`.

Segments are refreshed every 24 hours. However, inclusion in a segment expires after 30 days by default or after a customer-specified expiration period. Refresh your segments by re-pushing them from Real-Time CDP prior to the expiration. To request a custom segment expiration, contact your Adobe Account Team.
