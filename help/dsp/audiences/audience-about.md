# About Audience Management in Advertising DSP

In DSP, you can create and manage audience segments and audience sets, which you can use as targets for your placements:

* You can collect your own first-party audience data by creating and implementing segments. You can later retarget users in the segment with ads or prevent users in the segment from receiving ads. You can create the following types of segments:

   * [Custom segments](/help/dsp/audiences/custom-segment-create.md) to track a) users exposed to ads from desktop, mobile, and CTV devices and b) users who visit specific webpages.

   * [CCPA opt-out-of-sale segments](/help/dsp/audiences/ccpa-opt-out-segment-create.md) to track the users IDs from consumer opt-out-of-sale requests on your website, per the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). You can retrieve monthly reports of the user IDs from opt-out-of-sale requests.

      For more information about Adobe Advertising support for CCPA opt-out-of-sale requests, see [Adobe Advertising Support for the California Consumer Privacy Act: Consumer Opt-out Support](/help/privacy/ccpa/ccpa-opt-out-of-sale.md).

* You can create an audience library of [reusable audiences](/help/dsp/audiences/reusable-audience-create.md). Saved audiences are composed of any of your available audience segments and any of your other saved audiences. Any changes you make to a saved audience are automatically applied to all placements that target or exclude the audience and to all other audiences that include the saved audience.

   Saved audiences allow media planners to group audiences as needed, by including and excluding multiple segments using complex Boolean logic. The size of each individual segment and the total audience size are indicated as you build an audience. Campaign executioners can then simply select one or more saved audiences as placement targets rather than manually configure audience targets for each placement.

Additional audience types are also available for placement targeting.

## Importing First-party and Third-party Data Segments

DSP can import your own first-party data segments from your data management platform (DMP) and provide them to any set of advertisers, as needed.

DSP is an integrated destination for [the [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Profile (CDP)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html), allowing you to share authenticated first-party segments with approved advertisers and users for campaign activation. To learn more about the Real-Time CDP integration, see the [Sources section](/help/dsp/audiences/sources/source-about.md).

DSP can also import custom third-party segments, including complex combinations of third-party segments. You can provide the segments to any set of advertisers, as needed.

Contact your [!DNL Adobe] account team for more information.

## Audiences Available as Placement Targets

You can target your placements to all of the following types of audiences.

* All user-created audience sets that were saved in DSP.

* All user-created audience segments that were created in DSP:

   * Custom segments for users who visited specific webpages and users exposed to impressions of specific ads.

   * CCPA opt-out-of-sale audience segments for users who submitted opt-out-of-sale requests on your website, per the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

* All of your imported first-party data segments.

* All of your imported custom third-party data segments.

* (Placements targeting the U.S. only) [All third-party data segments available to DSP customers from over 30 providers](/help/dsp/audiences/third-party-data-providers.md), including [!DNL Acxiom], [!DNL Datalogix], [!DNL eXelate] ([!DNL Nielsen]), [!DNL Lotame], [!DNL Oracle], [!DNL Quantcast], and many more.

   You can target specific segments, which target users based on audience data (for example, users with specific demographics, interests or intents, and/or behavioral profiles). You can browse by data provider and category, search for segments by name or segment ID, or filter the results by data provider, total segment size, web browser count, or devices count.

   Third-party segments incur additional fees, which are indicated next to each segment name.

* (Advertisers with Adobe Experience Platform and [!DNL Real-Time CDP], Adobe Audience Manager, or Adobe Analytics who use Adobe Advertising JavaScript conversion tags only) All of your available first-, second-, or third-party audience segments created in [!DNL Real-Time CDP], created in Audience Manager, or published to Adobe Experience Cloud from Audience Manager or [!DNL Analytics].

   Pricing for the use of the segments is pre-negotiated and isn't visible in DSP.

   Segments from [!DNL Analytics] are available about an hour after you create or publish them as Experience Cloud audiences. Segments coming directly from Audience Manager or [!DNL Real-Time CDP] are available within 24 hours after you share them.

## Audience Size Data

Within saved audience settings and placement settings, you can see detailed audience size data:

* The total and active deduplicated audience size across all selected segments and saved audiences is displayed, and you can view details by device type (browser, mobile, or connected TV).

* For individual segments and saved audiences, the total audience size and CPM (when applicable) are displayed next to the segment name. You can view more details about the segment, including the size by device type (browser, mobile, or connected TV). For saved audiences, the total size is the deduplicated total.
