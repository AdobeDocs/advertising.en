# Share or Stop Sharing a Segment

You can share your custom segments and CCPA opt-out of sale segments with additional DSP user accounts. Sharing a segment makes the segment available at [!UICONTROL Audiences] > [!UICONTROL Segments] and on the [!UICONTROL Custom Segments] tab in the specified users' placements and reusable audiences.

You can also stop sharing a segment with other DSP user accounts.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** > **[!UICONTROL Segments]**.

1. Hold the cursor over the segment row and click **[!UICONTROL Share]**.

1. Do either of the following:

    * To share the segment:

      1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL E-mail Address]** for the DSP user, and then click **[!UICONTROL +]**.

      1. (Optional) For each additional user, enter another **[!UICONTROL E-mail Address]** and then click **[!UICONTROL +]**.

    * To stop sharing the segment with a user, click **[!UICONTROL Unshare]** next to the email address.
