# Delete a Reusable Audience

You can delete an audience that isn't used in any placements or other reusable audiences.

If an audience is currently used, then you'll have the option to export a [!DNL Microsoft Excel] worksheet showing all placements and audiences that use the audience.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** > **[!UICONTROL All audiences]**.

1. Hold the cursor over the audience row and click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

1. (If the audience is used in any placements or other reusable audiences; optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Export XLS]** to download a worksheet file (in XLSX format) according to your browser's normal procedure.

    The filename includes the audience name and date.

1. (If the audience can be deleted) In the confirmation message, click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
