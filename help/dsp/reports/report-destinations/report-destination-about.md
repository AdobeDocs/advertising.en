# About [!UICONTROL Report Destinations]

You can create and manage delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type. Once you save a report, you can't change the destination type.

## Available [!UICONTROL Destination Types]

* [!DNL Amazon Simple Storage Service] ([!DNL S3])
* FTP
* SFTP
* FTP SSL (in beta)

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can also deliver your custom reports to email recipients, which don't require a saved report destination. You can specify email recipients, instead of saved destinations, within the report settings.

## The [!UICONTROL Report Destinations] View

The [!UICONTROL Report Destinations] view shows all of your existing destinations and the number of reports linked to each. You can filter the list by destination type. 

You can create new destinations, and edit and delete existing destinations, from this view.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Updating the credentials for your existing report destinations won't interrupt report delivery, as long as the credentials are valid.
