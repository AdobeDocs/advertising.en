# Adobe Advertising Universal ID Requirements Policy

<!-- In TOC, but hidden from TOC and both external and internal search -->

Last updated: February 29, 2024

This Universal ID Requirements Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the requirements for the use of Universal IDs in connection with Ads distributed via [!DNL Adobe's] On-demand Services for Adobe Advertising (“Services”). This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Agreement between [!DNL Adobe] and the Customer (“you”) using the On-demand Services. Capitalized terms used in this Policy but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth in that Agreement.

[!DNL Adobe] reserves the right to determine, in its sole judgment, whether an Ad or the website(s) to which the Ad redirects or links, violate the requirements of this Policy, in which event [!DNL Adobe] may reject such Ad and/or terminate or suspend access to the Services on that basis.

In addition to the requirements set forth below and in the Agreement, you must comply with the requirements imposed by each Universal ID provider with which you choose to engage as well as those imposed by any supply side platform (SSP) or other platform used to deliver any of your Ads. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the policies of the publishers and platforms through which you deliver Ads. 

## Client Data Requirements

### Prohibited Data

By electing to use the Universal IDs made available via the Services you agree to ensure that all Client Data transmitted, stored, displayed, distributed, or otherwise made available by you via the On-demand Services is consistent with the following Universal ID specifications and any other requirements of this Policy, as may be revised by [!DNL Adobe] from time to time. 

* Client Data has been collected by you directly from users or licensed by you from another party that either (i) collected the Client Data directly from the users to which such data relates or (ii) obtained the Client Data via intermediaries that obtained the data from another party that collected such data from the user, provided that you are able to identify the original party that collected the Client Data from the users to which the data relates.

* Client Data has not originated via web scraping or the purchase of a database from a source disconnected from the original collection of the data.

* You have provided all notices and obtained all consents required to disclose the Client Data to [!DNL Adobe] and its partners for the purposes set forth in the Agreement.

* Client Data does not relate to any individual (i) who has exercised an option that you have directly or indirectly committed to honoring with respect to creation or use of data for targeted audiences (“Opt Out”), (ii) who you know to be a minor (minor being individuals under the age of majority defined by law in any applicable jurisdiction), or (iii) where you possess actual knowledge that such individual suffers from a particular health condition.

* If you receive an Opt Out following the Effective Date of the Agreement, you will no longer utilize the Universal ID of such Opted Out user.

### UID2 Prohibited Countries

## No Discrimination
