# Adobe Advertising Acceptable Health Segment Guidelines

*For Adobe Advertising DSP and [!DNL Adobe Advertising Search]*

The following guidelines outline unacceptable and acceptable health-related audience segments. They also recommend tactics to use as alternatives to targeting health-related audience segments.

These guidelines are summarized from the [!DNL Network Advertising Alliance (NAI)].

See also [Adobe Advertising Ads Requirements Policy](/help/policies/ad-requirements-policy.md) to determine whether a health-related audience segment is usable per the Adobe Advertising targeting policy.

## Health Segments That Should Not Be Used

* Segments that rely on protected health information (PHI)\*, user-level medical records, pharmaceutical prescriptions, or similar health or medical sources that provide actual knowledge of that user’s condition or treatment.

    \* Adobe Advertising is not a [!DNL HIPAA]-ready solution.

* Segments that target health conditions (or related treatments), such as any form of cancer, mental health, drug addiction, sexually transmitted diseases, conditions predominantly affecting children, or other sensitive health conditions that cannot be treated with over-the-counter medications (for example, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, or diseases fibromyalgia).

* Segments that rely on a user or device’s prior web activity, app usage, or viewed content activity expressing an interest in a sensitive health or medical condition or treatment (as described in the block above).

## Health Segments That Can Be Used

All of the following must be true:

* The audience segment must include at least 10% of the targetable population.

* The audience segment relies only on demographic information, such as age, gender, education level, and/or residential setting.

* The audience segment name is labeled in such a way that is based on the audience’s demographic make-up and not labeled with a health condition (for example, “women over 50” but not “breast cancer,” or “skin care” but not “acne sufferer”).

## Additional Recommended Tactics

* Target geographies where there’s a high propensity of the target audience, and/or if there are professions/profiles that index high.

* Use contextual targeting for keywords that index high with but are not explicitly drug addiction-related or tied to any audience.

* Target demographic segments that index highly towards your target audience.
