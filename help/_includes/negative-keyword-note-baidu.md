>* [!DNL Baidu] allows only one match type per keyword per ad group. For example, Ad Group 1 can't include both `"keyword"` and `[keyword]`.
>* You can set negative keywords at the campaign and ad group levels from either the campaign and ad group settings or from the [!UICONTROL Keywords] > [!UICONTROL Negatives] view. Campaign-level negatives are applied at the ad group level.
