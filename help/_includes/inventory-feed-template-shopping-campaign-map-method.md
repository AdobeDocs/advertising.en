# Text ad template - Campaign Map Method

**[!UICONTROL Map Method]:** (When [!UICONTROL Map Only] is enabled for the campaign) The method by which new ad groups (not available for [!DNL Yandex]), keywords, and ads are mapped to existing campaigns:

* *[!UICONTROL Contains Anywhere]:* Adds data to an existing campaign whose name includes the specified string, if it exists.

* *[!UICONTROL Contains Exactly]:* Adds data to an existing campaign whose name includes the specified string, if it exists.

* *[!UICONTROL Exactly Matches]* (the default): â€” Adds data to an existing campaign with the same name, if it exists.

When no match is found, all data for the campaign is ignored. If multiple campaign matches are found, then the keywords and ads are mapped to all of them.
