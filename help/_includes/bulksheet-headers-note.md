# Note to include below header names in bulksheet appendix files

>[!NOTE]
>
>* This list shows all possible headers in a generated bulksheet file. If you don't include all available bulksheet rows and fields when you download a bulksheet, then your bulksheet file will include fewer headers. If you manually create a bulksheet, you can include only the headers required for the operation you want to perform.
>* This list uses comma-delimited values. If you use tab-separated values instead, then adjust the data accordingly. For more information, see "[Supported bulksheet file formats](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-data-formats/bulksheet-file-formats.md)."
