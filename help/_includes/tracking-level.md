# Tracking Level field in account and campaign settings

**[!UICONTROL Tracking Level]:** (For [!UICONTROL EF Redirect] only; available at the account and campaign levels; not applicable to ad networks that are enabled for parallel tracking) The level at which clicks and revenue should be tracked by adding a redirect (when relevant) and append parameters to the relevant URLs:
  
* *[!UICONTROL Keyword]:* To track data at only the keyword level.

* *[!UICONTROL Ad]:* To track data at only the ad level.

  **Note:** Changing an existing campaign to this setting deletes any existing keyword tracking IDs. Also, if you want to perform multivariate testing by using multiple landing pages for an ad, then create a bulksheet file and edit it for the required components.
  
* *[!UICONTROL Keyword and Ad]:* To track data at both the keyword and ad levels.
  
**Notes:**

* Only "[!UICONTROL Keyword]" is available for [!DNL Naver].
* Only "[!UICONTROL Ad]" is available for [!DNL Yandex].
