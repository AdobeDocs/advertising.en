# Text ad template - Initial Budget

**[!UICONTROL Initial Budget]:** (Optional) The budget for each new campaign created. Enter either a numeric value or a column name. If you use a column name, then the lowest value for that column that is processed by the template is used. To insert a column name as a dynamic parameter, click in the input field, and then click a column name in the column list. If you don't enter a budget, each campaign created uses the default budget for the account.

>[!TIP]
>
>[Add the campaign to a portfolio](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaign-assign-to-portfolio.md) and enable the portfolio option to "[!UICONTROL Auto adjust campaign budget limits]" to let Search, Social, & Commerce automatically adjust the budget to optimize spending for the entire portfolio.
