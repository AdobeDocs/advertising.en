# Location Targets field in some campaign settings and in MS ad group settings

<!-- MS performance max campaigns, MSA ad groups, Baidu campaigns, YJP campaigns -->

**[!UICONTROL Location Targets]:** (When available) Specific user geographical locations to include or exclude as targets. By default, all locations are targeted. You can include and exclude users in any combination of locations. Exclusions always override inclusions.

* To target all locations, don't select any locations.

* To include a location and its child locations, click the circle next to it once so that a blue checkmark (![Include](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/include.png "Include")) appears. You can optionally increase or decrease bids by a specified percentage for each location targeted.

* To exclude a location, click the circle next to it twice so that a red checkmark (![Exclude](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/exclude.png "Exclude")) appears.

* To expand a location into its subcomponents (such as the states, prefectures, regions, or cities), click the location name.

* To search for a location, enter or paste at least the first three characters of the location in the input field.
