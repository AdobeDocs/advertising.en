# Text ad template - Ad Group Map Only

**[!UICONTROL Map Only]:** (All ad networks except [!DNL Yandex]; optional) Maps all new keywords and ads to existing ad groups, rather than creating new ad groups. If you enable this option, select the mapping method.

Using [!UICONTROL Map Only] at the ad group level requires an existing account structure that's closely tied to the product taxonomy and easily maps to the data feed.
