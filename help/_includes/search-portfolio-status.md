# Portfolio status

<!-- used in multiple procedures -->

* *Draft:* The portfolio is missing an objective or at least one assigned, active campaign. This status is set automatically, and it automatically changes to *inactive* when you assign the missing settings and save your changes.

* *Inactive:* Search, Social, & Commerce gathers cost/click/impression data for the relevant campaigns for reporting purposes.

* *Active:* (Existing portfolios with all required settings; requires at least one active campaign with at least one active bid unit) Search, Social, & Commerce gathers cost/click/impression data and revenue data for the relevant campaigns and models the data.

* *Optimized:* (Existing portfolios with all required settings; requires at least one active campaign with at least one active bid unit) Search, Social, & Commerce gathers cost/click/impression data and revenue data for the relevant campaigns, models the data to determine optimization strategies, and optimizes the portfolio as required for the portfolio type and campaign bid strategies. The following may be optimized: bids for keywords and ads, (when enabled) bid adjustment values, (when enabled) campaign budgets, and bid strategy targets. You can't change the status to "optimized"unless the portfolio contains at least one active campaign with at least one active ad and keyword/placement. **Note:** If you remove all campaigns from an optimized portfolio or delete them, then the portfolio state is automatically changed to "inactive."
