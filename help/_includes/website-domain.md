# Website Domain field in GGL and MS search campaign settings

**[!UICONTROL Website Domain]:** (Search network only; applicable to expanded dynamic search ads only) The root domain (such as example.com) or subdomain (such as shoes.example.com) of the website whose content the ad network will use to target your dynamic search ads.

**Notes:**

* Expanded dynamic search ads target website content, rather than keywords.

* Your domain must be indexed by the ad network's organic search index to be targeted.

* If you don't specify a domain, then you must create dynamic search targets, which target either all of your website pages or a subset of pages, for each ad group.
