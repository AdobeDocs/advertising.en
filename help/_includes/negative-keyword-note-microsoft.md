# Note for Negative Keywords field in Microsoft campaign and ad group settings

>[!NOTE]
>
>* The maximum length per keyword is 100 characters.
>* You can set negative keywords at the campaign and ad group levels from either the campaign and ad group settings or from the [!UICONTROL Keywords] > [!UICONTROL Negatives] view. Campaign-level negatives are applied at the ad group level.
>* Changing a [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] keyword deletes the existing keyword and creates a new one with a new keyword ID. Changing the match type, however, doesn't delete the existing keyword.
