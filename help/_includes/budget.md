# Campaign-level Budget field

**[!UICONTROL Budget]:** The budget, which is the amount you want to spend daily, on average.

If you assign this campaign to a portfolio for which campaign budget limits are automatically adjusted, then &mdash; depending on search conditions &mdash; you may actually spend more or less than the specified budget in any given period. In addition, any manual changes to the campaign budget &mdash; from within Search, Social, & Commerce or the ad network &mdash; may be overwritten by the optimization capability.
