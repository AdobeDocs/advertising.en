# Text ad template - Label Classifications

**\[Component\] [!UICONTROL Label Classifications] &gt; \[Label Classification and Value\]:** (Optional) Values for up to five existing label classifications to assign to the different campaign components that are created or edited using the template. Label values are inherited by child entities (including child entities that are created later), so you don't need to enter values for child entities unless you want to override the inherited values. Label classifications for product groups are applied to the unit (most granular) level.

For each campaign component to which you want to assign label classifications:

1. Click the check box next to **\[Component\] [!UICONTROL Label Classifications]**.

1. Configure the label classification values for the template:

   * For each label classification and value to assign to the component, do the following:
   
     1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Label Classification]**.
     
     1. Select the existing label classification, and then either select an existing value or enter a new value.
     
        The maximum length for each value is 100 characters, and it can include ASCII and non-ASCII characters.
        
        To insert a column name as a dynamic parameter for a label classification value, click in the input field (the second field), and then click a column name in the column list.

         You can include only one value per classification per campaign component. For example, a campaign can have Color=Red but not Color=Red and Color=Blue.

   * To change an existing label classification value, select or enter a new value.
   
   * To remove an existing label classification value, click **[!UICONTROL X]** next to the value.
