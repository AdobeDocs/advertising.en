# Adobe Advertising AMO IDs {#amo-id}

## Adobe Advertising AMO IDs {#amo-id}

The AMO ID tracks each unique ad combination at a less granular level and is used for [!DNL Analytics] and Customer Journey Analytics data classification and ingestion of advertising metrics (such as impressions, clicks, and cost) from Adobe Advertising.

For [!DNL Analytics], the AMO ID is stored in an [eVar](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/dimensions/evar.html) or rVar dimension (AMO ID).

For Customer Journey Analytics, the AMO ID is stored in the `trackingCode` property of the `conversionDetails` object, which is part of the [!UICONTROL Adobe Advertising Cloud ExperienceEvent Full Extension].

The AMO ID is also called the `s_kwcid`, which is sometimes pronounced as "[!DNL squid]."

### ([!DNL Analytics] users) Ways to Implement the AMO ID {#amo-id-implement}

<!-- Add info about implementing in CJA -->

The parameter is added to your tracking URLs in one of the following ways:

* (Recommended) When the server-side insertion feature is implemented.

  * DSP customers: The pixel server automatically appends the s_kwcid parameter to your landing page suffixes when an end user views a display ad with the Adobe Advertising pixel.

  * Search, Social, & Commerce customers:

    * For [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts with the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] setting enabled for the account or campaign, the pixel server automatically appends the s_kwcid parameter to your landing page suffixes when an end user clicks an ad with the Adobe Advertising pixel.
    
    * For other ad networks, or [!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] accounts with the [!UICONTROL Auto Upload] setting disabled, manually add the parameter to your [account-level append parameters](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-manage.md){target="_blank"}, which append it to your base URLs.

* When the server-side insertion feature isn't implemented:

  * DSP customers: The [JavaScript code](javascript.md) automatically records click-throughs and view-throughs. When a browser doesn't support third-party cookies, you can still track click-based conversions for the following ad types:

    * For [!DNL Flashtalking] ad tags, manually insert additional macros per "[Append [!DNL Analytics for Advertising] Macros to [!DNL Flashtalking] Ad Tags](/help/integrations/analytics/macros-flashtalking.md)." **Note:** This procedure isn't necessary if your organization has a direct partnership with [!DNL Flashtalking] and you use data-pass macros to track the `s_kwcid` and `ef_id` tracking parameters per the [!DNL Flashtalking] support documentation at [https://support.flashtalking.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409808166419-Accessing-Data-Pass-Macros](https://support.flashtalking.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409808166419-Accessing-Data-Pass-Macros).

    * For [!DNL Google Campaign Manager 360] ad tags, manually insert additional macros per "[Append [!DNL Analytics for Advertising] Macros to [!DNL Google Campaign Manager 360] Ad Tags](/help/integrations/analytics/macros-google-campaign-manager.md)."

  * Search, Social, & Commerce customers:
  
    * For ([!DNL Google Ads] and [!DNL Microsoft Advertising]) ads, manually add the AMO ID parameter to your landing page suffixes, ideally at the [account level](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-manage.md){target="_blank"} unless different tracking for individual account components is necessary.

    * For ads on all other ad networks, manually add the AMO ID parameter to your [account-level append parameters](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/ad-network-account-manage.md){target="_blank"}, which append it to your base URLs.

To implement the server-side insertion feature, or to determine the best option for your business, talk to your Adobe Account Team.
