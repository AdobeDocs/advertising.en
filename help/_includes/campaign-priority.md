# Campaign Priority field in GGL and MS shopping campaign settings in grid and in ACM templates

**[!UICONTROL Campaign Priority]:** (Shopping campaigns only; read-only for existing campaigns) The priority with which the campaign is used when multiple campaigns advertise
the same product: *[!UICONTROL Low]* (the default for new campaigns), *[!UICONTROL Medium]*, or *[!UICONTROL High]*.

When the same product is included in more than one campaign, the ad network uses the campaign priority first to determine which campaign (and associated bid) is eligible
for the ad auction. When all of the campaigns have the same priority, the campaign with the highest bid is eligible.
