# [!UICONTROL Pixel]

All existing event tracking pixels for the placement are automatically attached. You can detach existing pixels and create new pixels as needed, based on your tracking needs for the individual ad. **Tip:** To edit the third-party tracking pixels for multiple ads in a placement at once using the [!UICONTROL Ad Tools] view, see "[Attach Third-Party Tracking Pixels to Ads in a Placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-pixel-attach-detach.md#attach-pixels-ads)."

The following settings apply to each pixel that you create or edit.

**[!UICONTROL Integration Event]:** The event that triggers the pixel to fire. For this ad type, use pixels that fires on the *[!UICONTROL Impression]* or *[!UICONTROL Click-through]*.

**[!UICONTROL Pixel Type]:** Whether the pixel is an *[!UICONTROL IMG URL]* (1x1 pixel image file), *[!UICONTROL HTML]*, or *[!UICONTROL JavaScript URL]*.

**[!UICONTROL Pixel URL or Code]:** The URL of the pixel image, in the appropriate format for the specified [!UICONTROL Pixel Type].

**[!UICONTROL Pixel Name]:** The pixel name. Use a name that helps you easily identify the pixel.
