# Paragraph used in intro to some bulksheet appendix files

Each bulksheet must include the header fields and corresponding data fields required for the [specific operations you want to perform](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/bulksheets/bulksheet-data-formats/bulksheet-operations.md) (such as creating an ad). When a field isn't required, you can omit it from the header and data rows. All custom columns are deleted when you upload the bulk sheet file.

The following are the available header fields and descriptions of the corresponding data fields, as well as more information about which are required to add, edit, or delete data.
