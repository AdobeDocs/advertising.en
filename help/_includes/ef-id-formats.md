# Adobe Advertising EF IDs

>[!NOTE]
>
>EF IDs are case-sensitive. If an [!DNL Analytics] or Customer Journey Analytics implementation forces URL tracking to lowercase, then Adobe Advertising doesn't recognize the EF ID. This impacts Adobe Advertising bidding and reporting but has no impact on Adobe Advertising reporting within [!DNL Analytics] or Customer Journey Analytics.

#### [!DNL Google Ads] search ads

```
{gclid}:G:s
```

where:

* `gclid` is the [!DNL Google Click ID] (GCLID).
* `s` is the network type ("s" for search).

#### [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] search ads

```
{msclkid}:G:s
```

* `msclkid` is the [!DNL Microsoft Click ID] (MSCLKID).
* `s` is the network type ("s" for search).

#### Display ads and search ads on other search engines 

```
<Adobe Advertising visitor ID>:<timestamp>:<channel type>
```

where:

* <*Adobe Advertising visitor ID*> is a unique ID per visitor (such as UhKVaAAABCkJ0mDt). Also called the *surfer ID*.

* <*timestamp*> is the time in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (such as 20190821192533 for Year 2019, Month 08, Day 21, Time 19:25:33).

* <*channel type*> is the channel type responsible for the click or exposure:

    * `d` for a click on a DSP display ad (display click-through)
    * `i` for an impression of a DSP display ad (display view-through)
    * `s` for a click on a Search ad (search click-through).
