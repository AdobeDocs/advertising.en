# Base URL field in most keyword and sitelink settings

<!-- GGL expanded text ad, keyword, placement -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>* The base URL may contain redirects within the landing page domain or subdomain but no redirects outside the landing page domain. Google Ads extracts the domain from this URL and adds any optional display paths for the ad to create the display URL.
>* Avoid using macros, which aren't substituted for clicks from sources that enable parallel tracking. If the advertiser must use macros, the Adobe Account Team should work with Customer Support or the implementation team to add them.
