# Row Level Value field in shopping ad templates

**[!UICONTROL Row Level Value]:** ([!UICONTROL Product Type] and [!UICONTROL Category] tiers only) Which values to use from the feed when the feed values are delimited by greater signs [`>`]. For example, if the tier targets `Product Type:L2=[Category2]` using [!UICONTROL Row Level Value] of 2, and the feed value in the
"`[Category2]`" column is "`Software>Graphics>Image Processing`," then "Graphics" is targeted. By default, the same level as the product type level or category level is selected.
