# Text ad template - Campaign Map Only

**[!UICONTROL Map Only]:** (Optional) Maps all new ad groups (not available for [!DNL Yandex]), keywords, and ads to existing campaigns, rather than creating new campaigns. If you enable this option, select the mapping method.

Using [!UICONTROL Map Only] at the campaign level requires an existing account structure  that's closely tied to the product taxonomy and easily maps to the data feed.
