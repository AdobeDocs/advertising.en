# Text ad template - Template Name

**[!UICONTROL Template Name]:** The name of the template. You can change the name of an existing template without any consequences. The template name can't include any of the following characters: `# % * | \ : " < >  . ? /` (`&` is allowed)

To create a new template with the same parameters as an existing template, clone the template and give it a new name. The ads that are created from the new template aren't associated with the ads created from the source template.
