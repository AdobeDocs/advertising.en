# Text ad template - Feed &amp; Columns

**[!UICONTROL Feed &amp; Columns]:** A [feed file](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/inventory-feeds/feed-files-manage.md) or merchant account associated with the template, and the columns (headers) for the selected file or account:

* *[!UICONTROL Feed File]:* Upload a file or select a file from the list of available feed files.

* *[!UICONTROL Google Merchant Center]:* Select a [synced [!DNL Google Merchant Center] account](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/merchant-account-manage.md). Search, Social, & Commerce creates only product groups; [!DNL Google Ads] auto-generates the shopping ads for the product groups. Custom columns aren't supported.

* *[!UICONTROL Microsoft Merchant Center]:* ([!DNL Microsoft Advertising] shopping templates only) Select a [synced [!DNL Microsoft Merchant Center] account](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/accounts/merchant-account-manage.md). Search, Social, & Commerce creates only product groups; [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] auto-generates the product ads for the product groups. Custom columns aren't supported.

Associating the template with a feed file or merchant account is optional until you are ready to create ads using the template.

When you insert a feed column in a template field, the inserted value is denoted as `[field_name]`, where "field_name" is the specified field name, to indicate that the value is a variable.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* If you change the feed file or account for an existing template, you may need to adjust the template parameters if the new file contains different headers.
>* If the feed file or account associated with the template is deleted or disabled, then the association is also deleted, and you must select a new feed file before you can create more ads using the template. If the new feed file or account doesn't include the same headers as the original file, then you may need to adjust the template parameters accordingly.
