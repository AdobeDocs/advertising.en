# Inventory Filter field field in GGL and MS shopping campaign settings

**[!UICONTROL Inventory Filter]:** (Shopping campaigns only; optional) Products with specific attributes to advertise for the campaign. If you don't specify inventory filters, then the ad network may advertise any product in your store.

You can enter up to seven product dimension-and-attribute combinations on which to filter your products, using the format `dimension=attribute`. Separate multiple filters
with a "`>>`" delimiter. For a list of available product dimensions, see "[Shopping campaign product filters](/help/search-social-commerce/campaign-management/campaigns/shopping-campaign-product-filters.md)."

The following example shows ads for Acme pet supplies:

`CategoryL1=animals>>CategoryL2=pet supplies>>Brand=Acme Pet Supplies`
