# Start Date field in some campaign settings and MS ad group settings

**[!UICONTROL Start date]:** The first date on which bids may be placed, as long as the campaign or ad group contains approved ads. The default for new campaigns and ad groups is the current day. To change the date for a campaign or ad group that hasn't started, enter a date in the format MM/DD/YYYY or click ![Calendar](/help/search-social-commerce/assets/calendar.png) and select a date.

Once a campaign or ad group has started, you can pause it but can't change the start date.
