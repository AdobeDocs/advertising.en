# Bid field in ad group settings

**[!UICONTROL Bid]:** The maximum cost per click (CPC) for an ad or cost per 1000 impressions (CPM) for an ad, as applicable for the ad network and campaign pricing model. Keyword-level bids override this value.

If an ad group with a CPC bid is in an optimized portfolio, then the specified bid is applied for one day. Afterward, the optimization capability places bids according to its own calculations.
