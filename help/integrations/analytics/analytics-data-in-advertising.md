# [!DNL Analytics] Data in Adobe Advertising

*Advertisers with an Adobe Advertising-Adobe Analytics Integration Only*

## Analytics Segments

All segments created in [!DNL Analytics] and published to Experience Cloud.

New segments take 24-48 hours to appear in Adobe Advertising. Updates to existing segments are synchronized within about eight hours.

<!-- I added "metric" to some of the links below, even though it looks redundant, because of syntax limitations: If you use [!DNL] or [!UICONTROL] as the sole text of a link (such as [[!UICONTROL Revenue]], the tag is included in the link text (such as "[!UICONTROL Revenue]") when it's published. -->

## Site Engagement Metrics

>[!NOTE]
>
>* [!DNL Analytics] passes events for the EF ID eVar into Adobe Advertising.  The default integration doesn't support sending calculated metrics or other dimensions (eVars) into Adobe Advertising. If the calculated metric can be wholly captured in a custom event, however, then Adobe Advertising can ingest the custom event.
