*Closed beta*

<!-- The following features are new or recently changed. -->

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 4 August 2025 | Audience targets for ad [!DNL] experiences] | More complex logic for audience inclusion and exclusion &mdash; the same logic available in Advertising DSP &mdash; is available within audience target settings. When you configure audience targets for an ad experience, you can now configure multiple segment groups and specify whether to include or exclude users based on the logic.<br><br>You can see the number of total audience members for each segment and the number of active and total audience members for each segment group.<br><br>With this option, the existing option to "[!UICONTROL Split targets to create nodes]" is no longer available. | See "[Add a target node to the final level](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-final.md)," "[Insert a target node between nodes](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-inner.md)," and "[Add a sibling target node](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-sibling.md)." |
| 10 July 2025 | Video creatives | Support is now available for first-party video creatives and for video-specific bundles and experiences:<ul><li>You can now upload first-party video creatives and add them to video-specific bundles. In bundle settings, the “[!UICONTROL Bundle Type]” options now include [!UICONTROL Standard Display], [!UICONTROL Dynamic Display], and [!UICONTROL Standard Video].</li><li>You can create video-specific ad experiences with video bundles. Ad experience settings now include an “[!UICONTROL Ad Type]” setting, with [!UICONTROL Standard Display], [!UICONTROL Dynamic Display], and [!UICONTROL Video] options. You can optimize video ads according to click-through rate, completion rate, or a custom goal.</li><li>Tags for video ad experience tags are defined by video duration and bitrate, rather than by ad size.</li><li>Video ads are automatically transcoded to Adobe Advertising DSP encoding so that you can preview them. You can optionally apply transcoding for other DSPs to any ad experience tag within [!UICONTROL Tag Manager].</li></ul> | See “[About your creative libraries](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-libraries-about.md),” “[Manage creative bundles](/help/creative/creative-libraries/bundle-manage.md),” “[Targeted experience settings](/help/creative/experiences/experience-settings-targeting.md),” “[Nontargeted experience settings](/help/creative/experiences/experience-settings-no-targeting.md), and “[Customize transcoding options for a video ad experience tag](/help/creative/experiences/experience-tag-video-transcoding.md).” |
| 21 May 2025 | [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] | You can now add images from your Adobe Experience Manager asset library to your [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] so that you can use them within ad experiences. | See "[Configure access to Adobe Experience Manager image assets](/help/creative/creative-libraries/aem-assets-configure.md)" and "[Add standard creatives to a creative library](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-add-standard.md)." |
| 10 February 2025 | [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] | Previously, you had one creative library. Now, you can create multiple libraries for each advertiser. | See "[About your creative libraries](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-libraries-about.md)." |
| | [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] > [!UICONTROL Creatives] | The [!UICONTROL Creatives] view includes tabs for [!UICONTROL Standard Ads] and [!UICONTROL Dynamic Ads].<ul><li>The **[!UICONTROL Standard Ads] tab** allows you to upload and manage image, HTML5, flexible HTML5, and third-party creatives.</li><li>The **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Ads]** tab allows you to manage dynamically generated ads that are created from uploaded feed files using defined ad templates; previously, dynamic ads were generated within [!DNL Adobe Advertising Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO)].<br><br> Currently, you can preview, duplicate, and delete dynamic ads. You can also attach dynamic ads to creative bundles for targeted ad experiences or to ad tags for non-targeted experiences. Only administrator users can dynamically generate ads.</li></ul> | See "[About your creative libraries](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-libraries-about.md)." |
| | [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] > [!UICONTROL Bundles] | Group multiple creatives into a *bundle* to easily add them to an experience. You can create standard ad bundles and attach standard creatives to them. Similarly, you can create dynamic ad bundles and attach dynamic creatives to them. | See "[Manage Creative Bundles](/help/creative/creative-libraries/bundle-manage.md)."|
| | [!UICONTROL Experiences] | In new ad experience settings, you now specify whether or not the experience uses decision tree targeting, and you can't change the setting once you save the experience. The workflows for experiences with decision tree targeting and experiences without decision tree targeting are different. | See "[Create an experience with targeting](/help/creative/experiences/experience-create-targeting.md)" and "[Create an experience without targeting](/help/creative/experiences/experience-create-no-targeting.md)."|
| | [!UICONTROL Experiences] | You can now create targeted experiences only with creative bundles from a single creative library, not individual creatives. You can still attach individual creatives from a single library to non-targeted experiences without decision tree targeting.<br><br>Because of the structural changes, your legacy experiences will be deprecated later this year. | Self-service customers: Rebuild your experiences in the new user interface. See "[Create an experience with targeting](/help/creative/experiences/experience-create-targeting.md)."<br><br>Managed service customers: Your Adobe Account Team will rebuild your experiences in the new user interface. |

| | DCO experiences | Legacy DCO experiences will be deprecated later this year. Your Adobe Account Team will rebuild your DCO experiences as dynamic ads in [!DNL Creative], except that DCO experiences with additional targeting will be rebuilt as [!DNL Creative] experiences. | &mdash; |
| | Ad tags | The ad server endpoint will change to the Advertising DSP ad server.<br><br>The new ad tag includes additional parameters to pass universal IDs (in addition to cookie IDs). | Self-service customers: Once an experience is available in [!DNL Creative], replace the ad tags in your existing campaigns. See "[Export and implement an ad experience tag for a live experience](/help/creative/experiences/experience-tag-export.md)."<br><br>Managed service customers: Your Adobe Account Team will replace the ad tags in your existing campaigns. |
| | Retargeting pixels | The retargeting pixel endpoint will change to the Adobe Advertising UDB service.<br><br>The new pixel includes additional parameters to pass universal IDs in addition to cookie IDs. | Self-service customers: Create and add the new retargeting pixels to your webpages. See "[Manage retargeting pixels](/help/creative/pixels/retargeting-pixel-manage.md)."<br><br>Managed service customers: Your Adobe Account Team will create and share new retargeting pixels if applicable; add the new pixels to your webpages. |
| | Conversion pixels | The legacy DCO pixels will be deprecated later this year, and [!DNL Adobe] conversion pixels will be required. | Self-service customers: Customers with [!DNL Analytics for Advertising] must replace DCO conversion pixels with the [!DNL Analytics for Advertising] [!DNL Last Event Service] pixels and the Adobe Analytics pixels. Everyone else must replace DCO conversion pixels with Adobe Advertising conversion pixels.<br><br>Managed service customers: Your Adobe Account Team will create and share all applicable Adobe Advertising conversion pixels; replace your DCO conversion pixels with Adobe Advertising conversion pixels. |
