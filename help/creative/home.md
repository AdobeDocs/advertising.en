| 17 November 2025 | Cost reporting for Advertising Creative | (Advertisers with both Advertising Creative and Advertising DSP only; beta feature) The new [!UICONTROL All-in Cost BETA] report shows how much spend was attributed to ad serving for Adobe Creative.

| 3 September 2025 | Creative optimization and scheduling for [!DNL experiences] | The menu option or button to configure creative optimization and scheduling is now called "[!UICONTROL Creative Optimization]" instead of "[!UICONTROL Edit Schedules]" or "[!UICONTROL Add Schedules]." | See "[Customize creative optimization and scheduling for a targeted experience](/help/creative/experiences/experience-optimization-scheduling-targeting.md)" and "[Customize creative optimization and scheduling for an experience without targeting](/help/creative/experiences/experience-optimization-scheduling-no-targeting.md)." |
|  | Ad rotation and scheduling for [!DNL experiences] | A new creative rotation type, "[!UICONTROL Sequencing]," rotates the associated creative bundles in a specified order (with Bundle 1 served first, Bundle 2 served second, and so on), with a specified total number of impressions across each bundle sequence. You can configure the final bundle in the sequence to a\) be displayed indefinitely or b\) loop back to the first bundle. | See "[Customize creative optimization and scheduling for a targeted experience](/help/creative/experiences/experience-optimization-scheduling-targeting.md)" and "[Customize creative optimization and scheduling for an experience without targeting](/help/creative/experiences/experience-optimization-scheduling-no-targeting.md)." |
| 4 August 2025 | Audience targets for ad [!DNL experiences] | More complex logic for audience inclusion and exclusion &mdash; the same logic available in Advertising DSP &mdash; is available within audience target settings. When you configure audience targets for an ad experience, you can now configure multiple segment groups and specify whether to include or exclude users based on the logic.<br><br>You can see the number of total audience members for each segment and the number of active and total audience members for each segment group.<br><br>With this option, the existing option to "[!UICONTROL Split targets to create nodes]" is no longer available.<br><br>If you had existing experiences with audience nodes that target multiple segments, they now are targeted using the "[!UICONTROL Include Any]" option, and the user must belong to only one of the segments to be eligible for an impression. Previously, the user had to belong to all of the segments. | See "[Add a target node to the final level](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-final.md)," "[Insert a target node between nodes](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-inner.md)," and "[Add a sibling target node](/help/creative/experiences/experience-target-node-add-sibling.md)." |

You can also attach dynamic ads to creative bundles for targeted ad experiences or to ad tags for non-targeted experiences. Only administrator users can dynamically generate ads.</li></ul> | See "[About your creative libraries](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-libraries-about.md)." |
