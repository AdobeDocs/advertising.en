# Customize your data views

*Closed beta*

## View data for another advertiser

* In your [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] and [!UICONTROL Experiences] views, select the advertiser in the advertiser list in the upper right.

![Example of an advertiser list](/help/creative/assets/advertiser.png "Example of an advertiser list")

## View data as cards or as tables

View the data in your [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries] and [!UICONTROL Experiences] views as individual cards or as tables/lists. By default, data is shown in card view mode. Card view shows a thumbnail of a relevant creative.

When you switch between card view and table view, your filters and selections are retained.
