# Manage asset files

## Upload an asset file

You can upload either a\) a ZIP file containing a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) and/or image files in the location that's specified in the spreadsheet<!-- verify --> or b\) just a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX).<!-- I don't think you should upload just plain image files without a spreadsheet, should you? I was able to, but I'm not sure that I can do anything with the image file. Although maybe you might want to update just images, or just other fields in the spreadsheet? I need to clarify this. -->

<!-- From Michelle's doc:

>[!NOTE]
>
>* If you have multiple images, create a single ZIP to upload them. Advertising Creative will automatically unzip the file making each image available.
>* For the best results (!-- why?--), include 20 or fewer images per ZIP file.

-->

<!-- VERIFY:  You need both a spreadsheet and image files to create a feed template (OR is it to create a catalog OR dynamic ads?) -->

<!-- 

What specific image file types are allowed? And what other requirements? 

What do you do with uploaded image files? Are they connected with a spreadsheet only if they're uploaded with the spreadsheet?

Should I give an example of a spreadsheet?  Or should we have a downloadable example in the UI?
