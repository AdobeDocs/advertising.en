# Manage asset files

Dynamic HTML5 ads require both a feed file in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) format and the image assets referenced in the spreadsheet. Static HTML5 ads require only a single image asset per ad.


>[!NOTE]
>
> You can use each feed file for only one catalog.

## File requirements

* Dynamic HTML5 ads:

  * A feed file in CSV, TSV, or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) format, with one header row and one data row for each ad variation. Include an image name in each row using the format `images/image_name` (such as `images/300x250_acme_logo.png`).

    The advertiser-specific field names must map to the [available fields for dynamic ad feed files](/help/creative/appendix-available-feed-fields.md).

  * The associated image assets in GIF, JPEG, JPG, or PNG format.<!-- Is this true: The maximum file size is two (2) MB. --> See the [supported creative sizes](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-sizes.md).

  You can upload a single XLSX file, a single image file, or a single ZIP file containing any combination of XLSX and image files.<!-- Check w/eng re any limitations or best practices WRT number of files and filesize allowed -->

* Static HTML5 ads:

  * One image asset per ad in GIF, JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

    You can upload either a single image or multiple images in a ZIP file.<!-- Check w/eng re any limitations or best practices WRT number of files and filesize allowed -->

## Upload an asset file

>[!NOTE]

>Instead of uploading asset files, you can also directly upload a catalog when you [add dynamic creatives to a creative library](/help/creative/creative-libraries/creative-add-dynamic.md). Any catalogs you create there become available within the [!UICONTROL Catalogs] view for future use.

      * Click **[!UICONTROL Select a file]** to locate the file on your device or network.

   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**.

All ZIP files are decompressed automatically. When you upload a spreadsheet file, the file is listed on the [!UICONTROL Feeds] subtab. When you upload an image file, the image file is listed on the [!UICONTROL Images] subtab.
