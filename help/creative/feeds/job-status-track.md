# Track the status of catalog processing jobs

See the status of your catalog processing jobs. If any errors occur during processing, the [!UICONTROL Failed Count] column indicates how many rows had an issue.

<!-- Validate and reword:

By clicking on "View Failure" on the right, you can see further details about the error. The most common errors are "Image processing error" where there is a missing image asset, or "Duplicate partnum" where the unique column has a non-unique name that is referenced in another feed or within the same feed file.
