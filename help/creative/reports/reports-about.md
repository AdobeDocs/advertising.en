# About Custom Reports

Custom reports allow you to customize the content and delivery of your report data using the metrics that matter most to you.

You can generate reports once, or schedule them daily, weekly, or monthly at 03:00 in the specified time zone according to specified criteria (such as every 15 days or on the 1st of each month). Once a report is generated, you can download it from [!UICONTROL Reports] > [!UICONTROL Custom Reports] or from linked [report destinations](/help/dsp/reports/report-destinations/report-destination-about.md) of the following types:

* [!DNL Amazon Simple Storage Service] ([!DNL S3])
* FTP
* FTP SSL <!-- (in beta) -->
* SFTP
