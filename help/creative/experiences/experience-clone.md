# Clone an experience

<!-- "Duplicate" like for creatives and bundles? If we change this, change text throughout -->

Create an experience by cloning an existing experience. The new experience is named `<original name> (copy) # 1` (or the next number in the sequence). For example, if you make two clones of "Test experience," then the clones are named "Test experience (copy) # 1" and "Test experience (copy) # 2."

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Creative]** > **[!UICONTROL Experiences]**.

1. Do one of the following:

   * In card view, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** next to the creative name, and then click **[!UICONTROL Clone]**.
     
   * In table view, hold the cursor over the row, click **[!UICONTROL More]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL Clone]**
