# Customize the tracking URLs for creatives in an experience with decision tree targeting

*Target nodes with existing creatives only*
*Closed beta*

For experiences with decision tree targeting, you can create up to five custom impression-tracking URLs, five custom click-tracking URLs, and one custom landing page URL for each individual creative used for the experience. You can customize the tracking URLs from within the decision tree.

The custom URLs are used only for ads created from the experience and aren't saved in the base creative settings in [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries].

1. Hold the cursor over the creative bundle leaf/folder below the target node and click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit Tracking URLs]**.

   The [!UICONTROL Click Tracking URLs], [!UICONTROL Impression Tracking URLs], and [!UICONTROL Landing URLs] tabs list the names of all creatives in the applicable sizes in the assigned bundles. The sizes of the default image creatives for the experience determine the available sizes.<!-- There's no distinct "Creative Sizes" setting. -->

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Click Tracking URLs]**, **[!UICONTROL Impression Tracking URLs]**, and **[!UICONTROL Landing URLs]** tabs, do the following for each creative as needed:

   1. Expand the row for the creative.

      * To remove a custom URL, hold the cursor over the creative row and click ![Delete](/help/creative/assets/delete.png "Delete").

      You can include up to five custom impression-tracking URLs, five custom click-tracking URLs, and one custom landing page URL.
