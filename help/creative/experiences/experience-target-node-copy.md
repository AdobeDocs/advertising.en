# Copy child nodes to another target node at the same level

*Experiences with decision tree targeting only*
*Closed beta*

You can copy all child nodes of a parent target node (including all child targets and the creative bundles assigned to them) to another target node at the same level. You can copy the nodes by either a) adding the copied nodes to the existing framework or b) completely replacing the existing framework. <!-- Give the main use case or an example to explain. -->

This feature doesn't affect the target specified for the parent node &mdash; it affects only the child nodes.

<!-- 1. [ways to get to the decision tree] -->

1. Click the parent node whose children you want to copy, click ![Add](/help/creative/assets/add.png "Add"), and then either a\) select **[!UICONTROL Copy Children ctrl+c]** or b\) enter **[!UICONTROL Ctrl+C]** ([!DNL Microsoft Windows]) or **[!UICONTROL Command-C]** ([!DNL Apple Macintosh]) on your keyboard.

1. Do either of the following:

   * To replace all child nodes and creatives for a node, click the node to which you want to paste the copied information, click **...**, and then either a\) select **[!UICONTROL Replace ctrl+shift+v]** or b\) enter **[!UICONTROL Ctrl+Shift+V]** ([!DNL Microsoft Windows]) or **[!UICONTROL Command-Shift-V]** ([!DNL Apple Macintosh]) on your keyboard.

   * (Nodes with multiple child targets, no "All" nodes, and no creatives only) To add all child nodes and creatives to a node, without deleting the existing ones, click the node to which you want to paste the copied information, click **...**, and either a\) select **[!UICONTROL Add ctrl+v]** ** or b\) enter **[!UICONTROL Ctrl+V]** ([!DNL Microsoft Windows]) or **[!UICONTROL Command-V]** ([!DNL Apple Macintosh]) on your keyboard.
