# Delete a target node or creative leaf node in an experience

*Experiences with decision tree targeting only*
*Closed beta*

You can delete a target node, including all child targets and the creative bundles assigned to them. You can also delete a creative leaf node.

<!-- 1. [ways to get to the decision tree] -->

1. Hold the cursor over the target node or creative creative leaf node click **[!UICONTROL ...]** > **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

1. In the confirmation message, click **[!UICONTROL Delete Node]**.

1. (Optional) To save the experience:
   
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**, and then **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
     
   1. (If each node at the bottom-most level doesn't include at least one creative): Do one of the following:
     
      * To save the experience without all required creative bundles, click **[!UICONTROL Save as Draft]**.
      
        You can't create an ad tag for a draft experience.

      * To assign the default creative to each target that hasn't already been assigned a creative bundle, click **[!UICONTROL Assign Default Creatives]**. After you review the updated tree with the default creatives assigned, click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
