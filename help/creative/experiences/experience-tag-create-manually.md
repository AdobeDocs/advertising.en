# (Experiences without targeting) Manually create an ad tag for an applicable creative size

*Experiences without decision tree targeting only*
*Closed beta*

You can create one or more ad tag for each creative size used for an experience. You can later [assign creatives to the ad tag](experience-tag-assign-creatives.md).

>[!NOTE]

>For experiences with decision tree targeting, [!DNL Creative] automatically creates one tag for each applicable creative size.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Creative]** > **[!UICONTROL Experiences]**.

1. Do one of the following:

   * In card view, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** next to the experience name, and then click **[!UICONTROL Tag Manager]**.
     
   * In table view, hold the cursor over the row, click **[!UICONTROL More]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL Tag Manager]**

1. In the upper right, click **[!UICONTROL Create Tag]**.

1. Enter a unique **[!UICONTROL Tag name]** and select the **[!UICONTROL Tag size]**.

   The available creative sizes are determined by the sizes of the default image creatives for the experience.

   You can create multiple tags for the same creative size.<!-- What are the implications? -->
