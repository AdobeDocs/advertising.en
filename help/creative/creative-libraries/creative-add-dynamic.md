# Add dynamic creatives to a creative library

Add dynamic creatives to your [creative libraries](creative-library-manage.md) to use with dynamic [ad experiences](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md). You can create either static HTML5 or dynamic HTML5 ads from a single ad template when those ad types are included in the template<!-- wording -->.<!-- for static, I don't see a catalog selection option, and I also don't see the Advanced Details/Content section. Clarify the process for each ad type. --> For dynamic HTML5 ads, you can use assets in specified catalogs that were created from feed files.
