# Delete creatives from a creative library

You can delete:

* creatives that aren't in a bundle that's assigned to a [live or draft](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md#experience-statuses-experience-statuses) [targeted experience](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md).

* creatives that aren't assigned to an ad tag for a live or draft [non-targeted experience](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md).

>If you delete a dynamic creative and generate new ads for the catalog using the same data that was used to create the original creative, then the creative is added back to the catalog.
