# Edit standard creatives in a creative library

You can edit some settings for each type of standard creative. You can edit multiple creatives<!-- or creative variations --> of the same creative type (simple HTML5 with only one landing page, static HTML5 with multiple landing pages, flexible HTML5, image, or third-party<!-- , or dynamic -->) only. 

For flexible HTML5 and static HTML5 creatives, you can upload a new template file with a different layout but the same set of attribute names. For simple HTML5 creatives, you can edit any attributes or add images by uploading a new template with the new attributes or images. In all cases, the template must be a local file in ZIP format with a maximum of 2 MB.

When you edit a creative<!-- or creative variation --> that's included in a bundle, your changes are automatically applied across all experiences that include the bundle, except that any custom landing pages and tracking URLs specified at the experience level remain applicable for the bundle that's attached to that experience.
