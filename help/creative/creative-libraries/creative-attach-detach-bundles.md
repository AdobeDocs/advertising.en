# Attach creatives to creative bundles

<!-- Edit all, including the metadata and title, plus the links within TOC and bundle-manage.md, once this feature is available.  -->

You can attach standard display creatives to standard display bundles, standard video creatives to standard video bundles, dynamic display creatives to dynamic display bundles, and dynamic video creatives to dynamic video bundles so that you can add them to [ad experiences](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md). Each bundle can include only one of each \[creative size or duration + language\] combination.

<!--
You can also detach a creative from a bundle to remove the association between the two, so that the creative is no longer used for experiences that target the bundle. Detaching a creative from the bundle doesn't delete the creative from the Creatives tab in your creative library.
