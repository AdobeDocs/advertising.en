# About your creative libraries

*Closed beta feature*

Your creative libraries allow you to manage the creatives that you'll use in your ad experiences. You can create multiple libraries, each with a set of creatives and *creative bundles*, which are groups of creatives that you can add to an experience as one unit.

Your libraries can include:

* **Individual creatives:** You can include individual creatives directly within ad experiences that don't have defined user targets. You can also use your creatives to create bundles, which you can include in targeted [ad experiences](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md).

  * **Standard creatives:** You can upload and manage creatives in [various formats](#creative-creative-formats). For each creative, you specify the default language for each ad with which you associate the creative, the default landing page that opens when a user clicks an ad that includes the creative, and optional labels to use as filters within various views within [!DNL Creative].

  * **Dynamic creatives:** (Existing Adobe Advertising DCO customers only) Administrator users can create dynamically generated creatives by mapping dynamic variables in an ad template to values in a feed file. All users can preview, duplicate, and delete existing dynamic ads.

* **Creatives bundles:** Group creatives into bundles to use across multiple experiences with defined user targets. You can create *standard bundles* that consist of standard ads and *dynamic bundles* that consist of dynamically generated ads. 

## Supported Creative Formats {#creative-creative-formats}

### Formats for Standard Creatives

You can add and manage the following creative types in the [supported creative sizes](creative-sizes.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Even if you intend to use HTML5, Flexible HTML5, or third-party creatives for your ad experiences, you must also add image creatives for each creative size you use.
>
>Each experience requires a default image creative for each creative size assigned to the experience. The default image creatives are used when a browser isn't JavaScript-enabled or when the ad server can't personalize the ad because of delays.

#### Flexible HTML5

Flexible HTML5 creatives are HTML5 creatives with all of their images and other attributes as standard HTML tags, which you can edit directly within [!DNL Creative], either within a creative library or within an individual experience (which creates a variation of the original creative). Flexible HTML5 creatives use the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Technology Laboratory's standard for an [ad portfolio](https://flexibleads.iabtechlab.com/), for which ad format sizes are flexible (rather than fixed) and are based on the adâ€™s aspect ratio and size range, and for which ads maintain their resolution across devices and publisher sites.

You can<!-- either --> upload flexible HTML5 creatives as ZIP files<!-- or use one of the [provided templates](flexible-html5-templates.md) as a starting point -->. See the [specifications for flexible HTML5 creatives](html5-creative-specification.md).

<!-- Will flattening the view be possible later?
The card view, by default, includes a card for each base flexible HTML5 creative you've uploaded, with the number of creative variations [Delete old description? : an indicator of how many variations of the creative exist]. You can optionally flatten the card view to include separate cards for each base creative and each derivation. The table view is always flattened.


[Example default card view for a flexible creative with variations]()[]add image]
  
[Example card for a flexible creative with one variation]() [add image]

 -->

You can optionally change the default values of the attributes specified in a flexible HTML5 creative. Later, you can specify custom values for the attributes within a specific experience, which creates a variation of the parent creative.

#### HTML5 creatives

You can upload simple or static HTML5 creatives, with all attributes and images specified, as ZIP files. You can't edit any attributes or add images; instead, upload a new ZIP file to add a new creative. See the [specifications for simple and static HTML5 creatives](html5-creative-specification.md).

#### Image creatives

You can include image creatives in GIF, JPEG, JPG, or PNG format. You can upload<!--LATER:   images from your Adobe Experience Manager accounts or --> images from your device or network.

Each ad experience requires a default image creative for each creative size assigned to the experience.

#### Third-party creatives

Enter JavaScript tracking tags for creatives hosted on third-party ad servers. The script varies by ad server; the following is an example:

```
<SCRIPT language='JavaScript1.1' SRC="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/adj/A123456.12345GDN.COM/B1234567.123456789;sz=300x250;ord=[timestamp];dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=?"></SCRIPT> <NOSCRIPT> <A HREF="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/jump/A123456.12345GDN.COM/B1234567.123456789;sz=300x250;ord=[timestamp]?"><IMG SRC="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/ad/A123456.12345GDN.COM/B1234567.123456789;sz=300x250;ord=[timestamp];dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=?"BORDER=0 WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=250 ALT="Advertisement"></A></NOSCRIPT>
```

### Format for Dynamic Ads

Administrator users can dynamically generate creatives in static HTML5 and dynamic HTML5 format by mapping dynamic variables in an ad template to values in a feed file. Dynamic creatives may include creatives from your legacy Adobe Advertising Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) experiences.
