# Configure [!DNL Creative] to access Adobe Experience Manager image assets

*Closed beta*

<!-- Is this relevant only to standard creatives? If so, then move into Standard Creatives chapter from where it is now -->

Before you can upload your existing Experience Manager image assets to your [!UICONTROL Creative Libraries], the advertiser account settings for your associated DSP account must specify the organization ID for the Experience Manager account. Contact your Adobe Account Team to configure this setting.
