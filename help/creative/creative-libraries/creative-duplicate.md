# Duplicate creatives

*Closed beta*

Duplicate creatives to add new creatives with the same settings to the same library. You can later rename the new creatives and edit the creative settings as needed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you duplicate a dynamic creative, the duplicate is added to the same catalog as the original creative.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Creative]** > **[!UICONTROL Creative Libraries]**.

1. Click the library name.

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Creatives]** > **[!UICONTROL Standard Ads]** tab, select the creatives:

   * To duplicate a single creative:
   
     * In card view, click **[!UICONTROL ...]** next to the creative name, and then click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.
     
     * In table view, hold the cursor over the row and click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.

   * To duplicate one or more creatives, select the check box for each creative that you want to duplicate. In the bulk actions toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.
   
     To select all rows, select the global check box in the upper left.

   The new creatives are named `<original name> (copy) # 1` (or the next number in the sequence). For example, if you make two duplicates of "Test image," then the duplicates are named "Test image (copy) # 1" and "Test image (copy) # 2."
